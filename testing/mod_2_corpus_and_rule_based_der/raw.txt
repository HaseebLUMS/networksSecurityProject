Overview
Software & Accessories
Support & Documentation
4K resolution
Axis’ Sharpdome technology
Axis’ Speed Dry function
Pan performance up to 700°/s
Repaintable
Designed for top performance PTZ surveillance
AXIS Q6128-E is a compact, outdoor-ready PTZ dome, offering 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, 12x optical zoom and autofocus. The 4K resolution provides four times as much detail as the standard HDTV 1080p resolution, improving the video quality significantly. To save bandwidth, you can view live video in HDTV 1080p while recording in 4K for forensic purposes.
Quick and precise pan of up to 700° per second makes it easy to change viewing position and follow fast moving objects. The camera is ideal for sports stadiums, squares, street junctions, open parking places and large open areas in shopping malls. AXIS Q6128-E also offers Electronic Image Stabilization, giving smoother video in windy conditions.
Axis’ Sharpdome technology and Speed Dry function
Axis’ Sharpdome technology provides full scene fidelity and perfect image quality in all directions – above as well as below the horizon – making AXIS Q6128-E suitable also for uneven terrain. The Sharpdome technology includes Axis’ unique Speed Dry function that gives clear images in rainy weather. It can also simplify dome cleaning, allowing for more efficient methods such as high pressure cleaning.
Optimized for maximum reliability
AXIS Q6128-E is designed for reliable, weatherproof installation with built-in protection against dust, strong water jets, rain, snow and sunlight (IP66 and NEMA 4X rating), and impact resistance (IK08 rating). The camera features defogging and is protected by shock detection that sends an alarm if someone tries to vandalize it.
Intelligent video
The built-in video analytics of AXIS Q6128-E includes Advanced Gatekeeper that allows the camera to detect an object in a specified area and zoom in on it. The camera also has substantial capacity for third-party intelligent video applications.

March 3, 2019Verified PurchaseI would definately recommend, these PTZ were used on an AXIS Camera Station system as I had attempted to use other ONVIF Compatible PTZ Cameras however AXIS Camera Station will ONLY work with Axis Brand PTZ Cameras.

Amazon Customer5.0 out of 5 starsReliable, Full Featured & High Quality
February 22, 2016Verified PurchaseThe features available in this Axis PTZ Network Camera are endless.
One feature I would like to highlight is being able to save specific locations for the Camera to be able to automatically move to after a specified duration.
This is called Guard Mode.
You can also set the Home Location & if the Camera get's moved, after a specified duration it will automatically return "home" so you don't miss any recordings.It's very responsive & when there has been issues, a power cycle almost always fixes the issue.
The other times, the camera has either not been installed correctly & water has gotten inside of it, or a power surge.
I highly recommend this camera for the features, quality & maintenance.
I have several of these models in the field & some have been in place for several years & are still running strong.

Overview of the Axis Q6215-LE
Part of the advanced Q61 series by Axis, this ultra-robust PTZ network camera provides a high-performance CCTV monitoring solution - combining the delivery of Full HD resolution at 60 frames per second, with highly precise pan/tilt/zoom capabilities and up to 400m of IR night-vision. This outdoor-ready, vandal-resistant model is designed for use in demanding applications and also includes a range of advanced imaging technologies for clear image capture in any lighting condition.
Suitable for deployment in extreme locations such as harbours and airports, this heavy-duty model meets the MIL-STD-810G standard - ensuring reliable operation in extreme weather conditions and the ability to withstand winds up to 152 mph. In addition, support for Axis' Arctic Temperature Control enables safe start-up in temperatures as low as -40°C; and the built-in wiper removes water or dirt that collects on the surface of the lens cover for clear image capture  regardless of weather conditions.
Variable pan/tilt movements (including 360° pan), alongside powerful 30x optical zooming, allow users to quickly and precisely navigate across large locations - ideal when closely monitoring a person or incident. Imaging technologies such as Axis' Lightfinder are also supported to deliver full colour viewing in ambient light extremes. In addition to this, long-range OptimisedIR technology (up to 400m) enables the camera's integrated IR LEDs to automatically adjust to the camera zoom - ensuring the entire field of view is evenly illuminated at all times.
Video motion detection alarms can be configured to alert users of activity via notifications such as email. When used in conjunction with Axis Guard Suite analytics, these alarms can also prompt certain tasks such as panning the camera to a pre-set location within the field of view. Integrated shock detection triggers the camera to send an alarm if the unit is hit - providing reliable, real-time detection of vandalism attempts.
With the use of Axis' Zipstream technology, bandwidth and storage requirements are lowered by an average of up to 50%. It optimises the video stream in real-time, allowing important details to be retained while unnecessary data is removed. Additionally, PoE+ support simplifies the installation process by delivering both power and network connectivity over a single cable. Installation is further simplified thanks to the units flexible design, which includes an installation plate with sliders and allows the camera to be mounted facing up or down depending on the users needs.
