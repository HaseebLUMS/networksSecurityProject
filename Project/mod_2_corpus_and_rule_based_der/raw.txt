Who's Online58 visitors online now3 guests, 55 bots, 0 membersMap of VisitorsBookmarksAmazon Web ServicesCloudSiksha BlogMicrosoft AzureVirtualBoxWindows 10 UpgradeHOW to HACK into Broadband ADSL Modem (Router) and get the BroadBand User ID and Password!! November 5, 2010 by Saugata55NOTE: Purpose of this article is to help people to protect their own ADSL Router, and how to made them more secure, to avoid such indecent in future. First connect to your broadband, and goto http://whatismyip.com to know your public IP Address.
Now you need Port Scanner software, here I used a free one from RadMIN. Open Port Scanner after install and type your IP Range like following figure and set port range from 80 to 81.Hit Scan button as soon as you finish above steps.
After finish scanning you have to look for the alive IP Addresses those have port 80 opened like following figure.Here I have found IP Address with port 80 opened. No you have to open that IP Address from internet Explorer like following figure.If everything went fine, It will ask you for user id and password, and out of 10 ADSL Router, at least 6 having default password, coz no one bother to change that default password L .So, give it a try with following ID and Pass:ID : admin / Pass : admin (most common) ID : admin / Pass : admin123 ID : admin / Pass : admin321 ID : root / Pass : root ID : root / Pass : admin ID : admin / Pass : root ETC…Wow!! I have got the access… Now I can do whatever I want. But I don’t want to do anything. 🙂
You can access any settings on the ADSL Router.Now you need an Asterisk Key recovery tool to get the broadband user ID and PasswordHere password recovered successfully in a second. 🙂
NOW, the question is how you are going to protect your own ADSL Router? Simple!! You have to check few things, add some extra security to avoid such incident in future. CHECKLIST! After Installation of your modem, ask the engineer about your modem user id and password. 90% of ADSL Modem using http://192.168.1.1 for their own console, so logon to that console and change your modem console password immediately. If you are using your modem to connect internet for only one system, it’s recommended to configure modem as BRIDGE type, coz, here you have to dial from your own desktop, so, it’s not required to save your broadband user id and password in your modem. In some router, you can restrict console access, if it is supported by your router, and then enable it for Private Network only. Finally, if you are reading this topic, then after reading, tell your friends about this hole, and secure yourself as well as your friends. 🙂Disclaimer: All posts and opinions on this site are provided AS IS with no warranties.

August 1, 2012 at 7:01 am	 The hardest part of this task is how do you manage to know what password on their modem. Ok, many people don’t bother or knowing how to change the password. If that was the case then easy, but if not than a brute force attack will do Reply

Akshat says:
April 30, 2013 at 12:56 pm	 hello, thanks for tips above. I want some help from you. Actually I have a BSNL ADSL+wifi router manufactured by teracom (Type W2 V1.00) model no. TDSL300W2 which I was using when I had a broadband connection from BSNL. But now I am having having a broadband connection hosted by a private company in Kanpur,UP. I was trying to connect it to the broadband modem of BSNL but it never connected and says DHCP not enabled on diagnosis. Can you let me way that I can use that modem as a router for my new internet connection. I think the problem is that the ip in the modem is set default to one that of BSNL (192.168.1.1) but the ip of my service provider is different and the DSL light keep on blinking.Help me please!!!Thanks. Reply
Saugata says:
July 2, 2013 at 4:20 am	 It will work on other provider as well, you have to configure it manually. If you are able to ping & access 192.168.1.1 and you are able to logon to the web gui, then you can configure it for different provider. You have to get the VPI & VCI value for other provider, also you have to make sure other provider support ADSL modem or not. Reply

Saugata says:
October 8, 2015 at 9:38 pm	 Yes, it is possible, but BSNL allow accessing broadband. Sometimes they restrict access against your modem MAC address, in that case you have to use same MAC address in your modem, and in most of the modem there was a option to change MAC address manually under settings.I will always recommended not to do so. Reply

October 1, 2015 at 4:10 pm	 great article man………really nice work. i have got access to many adsl modems thanks to you. but i got 2 question.. 1 why u select port 80-81 only? 2 now i have access many modems but how can i use or divert
their bandwidth on my computer Reply
Saugata says:
October 8, 2015 at 9:36 pm	 1 – Port 80/81 is the default port for web access. 2 – You you can, but depending on how ISP allow accessing broadband. Sometimes they restrict access against your modem MAC address, in that case you have to use same MAC address in your modem, and in most of the modem there was a option to change MAC address manually under settings. I will always recommended not to do so. Reply

Saugata says:
March 1, 2016 at 1:53 am	 Sorry for late response, could you please let me know which model you are using?DD-WRT or openwrt provide advance firmware for many modems / router. I am using TP Link router with DD-WRT firmware for last two years without having any issue. There are many additional option including MAC cloning, where you can virtually change your router MAC address and able to connect using your friends credentials.I don’t understand your last question, is it like you what to share your Internet connection via wifi?Regards, Saugata D Reply
fritz says:
October 29, 2015 at 6:24 am	 this is total crap. the reason why it works is, you are actually within the network and despite trying to get to the website from outside, the access is routed inside the network. just take your smartphone, disable your wifi and try it with your smartphone connection (external connetion => now your really access from outside the network) … et voila … no access. Reply
Saugata says:
November 3, 2015 at 6:51 am	 I think you misunderstood, this is from external network, used port scanner to scan public IP range to find out opened ports. Reply
Saugata says:
March 1, 2016 at 1:41 am	 It will work if your ISP gave you public IP when you are connecting to Internet. In India BSNL assign public IP to every ADSL connection. Reply
surya says:
December 8, 2015 at 1:20 pm	 THE best way to protect is through MAC ID filtering . Entry the your required wifi enable lap/mobiles WIFI MAC ID to the modem. only these gadgets can access to the network Reply
Saugata says:
December 11, 2015 at 9:16 am	 Yes, it is true, but not recommended for everyone, in case of any wrong entry, someone will end up with resetting the router. ReplyPingback: How To Get Into A Network Without Password | How To Get

Saugata says:
June 12, 2016 at 4:12 pm	 Do a factory reset.Steps: The Router may be reset to the original factory default settings by using a ballpoint or paperclip to gently push down the reset button in the following sequence: 1. Press and hold the reset button while the device is powered off. 2. Turn on the power. 3. Wait for 10 seconds and then release the reset button.Remember that this will wipe out any settings stored in flash memory including user account information and LAN IP settings. The device settings will be restored to the factory default IP address 192.168.1.1 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, the default management Username is “admin”and the default Password is “admin.” Reply

Router Hack – How to hack ADSL router using NMAP

Cracking, Hacking, Kali Linux, Security

Asynchronous digital subscriber line (DSL or ADSL) modem is a device used to connect a computer or router to a telephone line which provides the digital subscriber line service for connectivity to the Internet, which is often called DSL or ADSL broadband. In this guide I will show you show you how to scan IP range for connected ADSL or DSL modem routers and find DSL ADSL router hack remotely. This guide applies to Windows, Linux or Mac, so it doesn’t matter what’s your Operating system is, you can try the same steps from all these operating systems. The term DSL or ADSL modem is technically used to describe a modem which connects to a single computer, through a USB port or is installed in a computer PCI slot. The more common DSL or ADSL router which combines the function of a DSL or ADSL modem and a home router, is a standalone device which can be connected to multiple computers through multiple Ethernet ports or an integral wireless access point. Also called a residential gateway, a DSL or ADSL router usually manages the connection and sharing of the DSL or ADSL service in a home or small office network.
Put this together with Wireshark hacking for http websites, you got a nightmare for the user behind that router as all their passwords and details can be tracked very easily.
What's in a DSL ADSL Router? - Click to expandWhat's in a DSL ADSL Router? - Click to expand
What’s in a DSL ADSL Router?
A DSL or ADSL router consists of a box which has an RJ11 jack to connect to a standard subscriber telephone line. It has several RJ45 jacks for Ethernet cables to connect it to computers or printers, creating a local network. It usually also has a USB jack which can be used to connect to computers via a USB cable, to allow connection to computers without an Ethernet port. A wireless DSL or ADSL router also has antennas to allow it to act as a wireless access point, so computers can connect to it forming a wireless network. Power is usually supplied by a cord from a wall wart transformer. It usually has a series of LED status lights which show the status of parts of the DSL or ADSL communications link:
Power light – indicates that the modem is turned on and has power.
Ethernet lights – There is usually a light over each Ethernet jack. A steady (or sometimes flashing) light indicates that the Ethernet link to that computer or device is functioning
DSL or ADSL light – a steady light indicates that the modem has established contact with the equipment in the local telephone exchange (DSL or ADSLAM) so the DSL or ADSL link over the telephone line is functioning
Internet light – a steady light indicates that the IP address and DHCP protocol are initialized and working, so the system is connected to the Internet
Wireless light – only in wireless DSL or ADSL modems, this indicates that the wireless network is initialized and working
Almost every ADSL DSL modem router provides a management web-page available via Internal network (LAN or Local area network) for device management, configuration and status reporting. You are supposed to login to the management web-page, configure a username password combination provided by your ISP (Internet service provider) which then allows you to connect to internet. The network is divided into two parts:
External Network
External network indicates the part where ADSL DSL modem routers connects to upstream provider for internet connectivity. Once connected to the ISP via a Phone line (ADSL DSL Modem routers can use conventional Copper Phone lines to connect to ISP at a much higher speed), the router gets an IP address. This is usually a Publicly routable IP address which is open to the whole world.
Internal Network
Internal network indicates the part where devices in Local Area Network connects to the ADSL DSL modem router via either Wireless or Ethernet cable. Most modem DSL ADSL Modem routers runs a DHCP server internally which assigns an Internall IP address to the connected device. When I say device, this can be anything from a conventional computer, a laptop, a phone (Android, Apple, Nokia or Blackberry etc.), A smart TV, A Car, NAS, SAN, An orange, A banana, A cow, A dragon, Harry Potter … I mean anything that’s able to connect to internet! So you get the idea. Each device get’s it’s own IP address, a Gateway IP and DNS entries. Depending on different DSL ADSL Modem router, this can be slightly different, but the idea remains the same, the DSL ADSL Router allows users to share internet connectivity. These DSL ADSL Modem Routers are like miniature Gateway devices that can have many services running on them. Usually they all use BusyBox or similar proprietary Linux applications on them. You want to know what a DSL ADSL Router can do? Here’s a list of common services that can run on a DSL ADSL Modem Router:
ADSL2 and/or ADSL2+ support
Antenna/ae (wireless)
Bridge/Half-bridge mode
Cookie blocking
DHCP server
DDNS support
DoS protection
Switching
Intrusion detection
LAN port rate limiting
Inbuilt firewall
Inbuilt or Free micro-filter
Java/ActiveX applet blocking
Javascript blocking
MAC address filtering
Multiple public IP address binding
NAT
Packet filter
Port forwarding/port range forwarding
POP mail checking
QoS (especially useful for VoIP applications)
RIP-1/RIP-2
SNTP facility
SPI firewall
Static routing
So-called “DMZ” facility
RFC1483 (bridged/routed)
IPoA
PPPoE
PPPoA
Embedded PPPoX login clients
Parental controls
Print server inbuilt
Scheduling by time/day of week
USB print server
URL blocking facility
UPnP facility
VPN pass-through
Embedded VPN servers
WEP 64/128/256 bit (wireless security)
WPA (wireless security)
WPA-PSK (wireless security)
That’s a lot of services running on a small device that are configured by nanny, granny, uncle, aunt and the next door neighbour, in short many non technical people around the world. How many of those configured badly? Left ports open left right and center? Didn’t change default admin passwords? Many! I mean MANY! In this guide we will use namp to scan a range of IP addresses, from output we will determine which are DSL ADSL Routers and have left their Management ports open to External Network. (again read top section to know which one is a external network). A typical ADSL Router’s Management interface is available via following URL:
http://10.0.0.1/
http://192.168.0.1/
http://192.168.1.1/
http://192.168.1.254/
etc.
This is the Management page for DSL ADSL modem router and it’s always protected by a password. By default, this password is written below a DSL ADSL modem router in a sticker and they are one of these combinations:
Username/Password
admin/admin
admin/password
admin/pass
admin/secret
etc.
A lot of the home users doesn’t change this password. Well, that’s ok. It doesn’t hurt much cause this is only available via a connected device. But what’s not OKAY is when users open up their management to the external network. All you need to know what’s the Public IP address for your target and just try to access this management page externally.
Installing NMAP
I use Kali Linux which comes with NMAP Preinstalled. If you are using Windows or Mac (or any other flavour of Linux) go to the following website to download and install NMAP.
Linux Installation:
For Ubuntu, Debian or aptitude based system NMAP is usually made available via default repository. Install NMAP using the following command:
sudo apt-get install nmap
For YUM Based systems such as Redhat, CentOS, install via
sudo yum install nmap
For PACMAN based systems such as Arch Linux, install via
sudo pacman -S nmap
Windows Installation:
For Windows Computers, download installer and run the executable. Link: http://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.46-setup.exe
Mac Installation:
For Mac users, download installer and install Link: http://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.46.dmg
Official NMAP site
You can read more about NMAP here: http://nmap.org/
Search for Vulnerable Routers
Now that we have NMAP sorted, we are going to run the following command to scan for ADSL Modem Routers based on their Banner on Port 80 to start our ADSL router hack. All you need is to pick an IP range. I’ve used an example below using 101.53.64.1/24 range.
Search from Linux using command Line
In Linux run the following command:
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1-255 -p80 -oG - | grep 'open' | grep -v 'tcpwrapped'
In Windows or Mac open NMAP and copy paste this line:
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1-255 -p80 -oG -
Once it finds the results, search for the word ‘open’ to narrow down results. A typical Linux NMAP command would return outputs line below: (and of course I’ve changed the IP details)
Host: 101.53.64.3 ()
Ports: 80/open/tcp//tcpwrapped///
Host: 101.53.64.4 ()

This was taking a long time (we are after all try to scan 256 hosts using the command above). Me being just impatient, I wanted to check if my Kali Linux was actually doing anything to ADSL router hack. I used the following command in a separate Terminal to monitor what my PC was doing… it was doing a lot …
tcpdump -ni eth0
That’s a lot of connected hosts with TCP Port 80 open. Some got ‘tcpwrapped’ marked on them. It means they are possibly not accessible.
Search from Windows, Mac or Linux using GUI – NMAP or Zenmap
Assuming you got NMAP installation sorted, you can now open NMAP (In Kali Linux or similar Linux distro, you can use Zenmap which is GUI version of NAMP cross platform). Copy paste the following line in Command field
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1/26 -p80 -oG -
another version of this command is using different representation of Subnet MASK.
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1-255 -p80 -oG -
Press SCAN Button and wait few minutes till the scan is over.
Once you have some results, then you need to find the open devices with open ports. In search Result page:
Click on Services Button
Click on http Service
Click on Ports/Hosts TAB (Twice to sort them by status)
As you can see, I’ve found a few devices with open http port 80.
It is quite amazing how many devices got ports open facing outer DMZ.
Access Management Webpage
Pick one at a time. For example try this:
http://101.53.64.3
http://101.53.64.4
http://101.53.64.129
You get the idea. If it opens a webpage asking for username and password, try one of the following combinations:
admin/admin
admin/password
admin/pass
admin/secret
If you can find the Router’s model number and make, you can find exact username and password from this webpage: http://portforward.com/default_username_password/ Before we finish up, I am sure you were already impatient like me as a lot of the routers had ‘tcpwrapped’ on them which was actually stopping us from accessing the web management interface to ADSL router hack. Following command will exclude those devices from our search. I’ve also expanded my search to a broader range using a slightly different Subnet MASK.
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1/22 -p80 -oG - | grep 'open' | grep -v 'tcpwrapped'
In this command I am using /22 Subnet Mask with 2 specific outputs: I am looking for the work ‘open’ and excluding ‘tcpwrapped’ on my output. As you can see, I still get a lot of outputs.
Conclusion
You’ll be surprised how many have default username and passwords enabled. Once you get your access to the router, you can do a lot more, like DNS hijacking, steal username and passwords (for example: Social Media username passwords (FaceBook, Twitter, WebMail etc.)) using tcpdump/snoop on router’s interface and many more using ADSL router hack … Why did I write this guide? I get lots of feedback via Contact Us page. Here’s one for example:
As you can see Jhefeson probably has a legitimate reason to try and reboot this shared router, but he can’t just because he doesn’t have physical access to it. If this guide works, he can actually get access back.
There’s many things you can do after you’ve got access to a router. You can change DNS settings, setup a tcpdump and later snoop all plaintext passwords using wireshark etc. If you know a friends, family. colleague or neighbor who didn’t change their routers default password, let them know of the risks.
But I am not here to judge whether it should be done or not, but this is definitely a way to gain access to a router. So hacking is not always bad, it sometime is required when you loose access or a system just wouldn’t respond. As a pentester, you should raise awareness. Share this guide as anyone who uses a Linux, Windows, Mac can use this guide to test their own network and fix ADSL router hack issue.

The best way for jhefeson to restart the the router is to go to his neighbour outdoor main electric power supply trip it off, wait 3 minutes and switch it on it back, wait 5-10 minutes for the router to back online. Plus the fact is the neightbour is out of town. Don’t worry about blackout.
Sometimes you need to be creative, not everything can be solved from ur machine.
Hope u can inform that to jhefeson. Glad if that could help.

Router have an public IP address like as 123.321.44.55
Ok i have access to the router
But how i can catch traffic and do MITM attacks on the user who is behind this router?
Router may be use NAT.

Pardon my ignorance, but where does the Nmap hacking part start? All you did was a scan for open ports/services on a network. If you want to know your home router’s IP, check the gateway on a client machine.
Great headline, but slightly dissapointing article.

Hello Tomas,
You got nmap scanning and saving IP in a file and hydra trying uname/passwd combination. I had to remove Hydra part that automates it.
No, you don’t really scan your own Gateway/Public IP. You can pick any IP range (/24) and scan it to see what’s in there. I happen to use an ADSL router so I scanned my Local ISP’s range. It was disappointing to see how many people mis-configured their home router. Cheers,

apt isn’t apptitude
you’re using options that leak your real ip even through a proxy (ie sS)
you’re uselesly grepping tcpwrapped and open when you could just tell Nmap to only show ports that are open(–open)
You’re using timing(T5) that quite probably is too fast and going to make your results inaccurate depending on network conditions.
You obviously looked up all this information or just threw together some options after reading the help file.
You explain nothing about what the options actually do
You have no clue (or never mentioned) that ISP supplied modems and routers don’t normally have remote access enabled or even have the option to do so which makes this entire article and what you did in it a waste of time and useless.
I’ve put this as politley as I can.
It is really annoying when sites claim they are teacing something when all they are doing is showing people how to make noise on a network and leak machine id’s, IP,s, OS fingerprints, MAC’s, software version ID’s etc etc all over the place.
Not to mention DNS leaks and not one mention about not using your ISP default DNS servers.
And the encouragement to use a bloated prepackaged OS like Kali is not how people learn anything.

Has anyone tried to login to their router with code?I want to automate some repetitive tasks like turning on/off the wireless radio and rebooting. I enabled telnet on the router and queried its commands, but there were none clearly labeled as such. Even the config file is encrypted so I can't modify that and reload. So, I assume I have to work the web cgi utility 192.168.1.1, and browse to the settings page and somehow send a click to a radio button and then hit apply button.I searched a bit through the forum but nothing stuck.Outside there are some iMacro recorders but I don't want my password encased in a 3rd party app.

I have done it for a few different routers (but in a different dialect of Basic).The problem is, every one is different in the way that they handle passwords.The first thing I do is install "Wireshark" and watch the traffic during a web browser session.That will give you the required steps.The rest is easy (sometimes).Jim

Ok, I guess network sniffing is the 1st step and then I use api to send the data bytes of my login.Thanks for the Wireshark link.

If the router uses a linux distribution for routers, usually BusyBox, you can normally do all that through telnet.Code:BusyBox v1.00 (2012.06.25-12:05+0000) Built-in shell (msh)Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.You can find help about the commands searching on google, there are PDFs with the commands listed etc.for example to bring up or down the wireless on my router (D-Link 2740B)ifconfig ath0 upifconfig ath0 downath0 is the interface (based on a Atheros chip, hence the name)Or you can go through HTTP as you are exploring now.

Unfortunately, my router only lists commands from the telnet dump and there is no direct documentation.The mfg(Actiontec) did make the firmware code available in a 150MB download
I hope it's well documented

Actiontec is linux based, GPL license. So you can to ask actiontec give u the source, its legal.By the way, i hear actiontec is stable on make connection , why u need reboot iI have plan to buy one skywalk wrote:Unfortunately, my router only lists commands from the telnet dump and there is no direct documentation.The mfg(Actiontec) did make the firmware code available in a 150MB download

I saw many Actiontec routers use BusyBox, are you sure yours doesn't ?In case you can try some commands from here and see if they works -> http://www.busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#commandsSorry if I insist, now I go and leave you alone

I need to force a reboot, since some users mentioned that improves upload speeds. I was experiencing the same slow downs.luis wrote:I saw many Actiontec routers use BusyBox, are you sure yours doesn't ?I haven't tried this yet, since I don't know how to invoke busybox on my router? I don't have a linux machine to debug.

wgetIn bold what you have to type (changing the IP obviously).You need to have the telnet service enabled on your router, check that in the http interface if it doesn't respond.

After my last adventure with a Belkin F7D2401is now on hold until I find a backup original bootloader, I started trying OpenWRT on a D-Link DSL-2750u.After opening up the case (goodbye brand new warranty), the board looks remarkably similar to that of the DSL-2650nru.Logging into the router (telnet) and /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo, /proc/diskstats and "df" shows the followings: > cat /proc/cpuinfo

I found a way to boot into CFE recovery mode without opening the box.Turn off, push and hold the reset button, turn on,  keep holding the reset button until the power LED become red.go to http://192.168.1.1 and upload the new firmware. I have changed the firmware to Billion 7700N (a similar device) and every thing was functional. Now I want to update to openwrt. But it seems that I can not use ADSL and WLAN. Is it possible to add binary driver of adsl and wlan manually?Which version of OpenWRT is suitable for this device?

Sorry to resurrect a rather old post, but is there any movement on support for this modem?It is rather popular here in South Africa, our telecom monopoly here supplies them as an ADSL router.

Hi All, I have the same router as D-Link 2750u. After fighting for last 3 days, I found that Chaos Calmer release for profile A4001N will work fine for this router. Of course the router name will come as A4001N but I don't mind that :)As you might already know OpenWRT does not support ADSL. I am using the modem as a wireless extender. I am using this router(client) to connect to my main router (AP to which ADSL connection terminates) wirelessly and connect my desktop to the Client router through LAN. This was not working with the stock firmware.Thanks OpenWRT, you saved me some bucks, without this I would have to buy WiFi PCI  card.Try the firmware here, https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … fs-cfe.binFor flashing, the OEM firmware update through the web interface will not work. You have to use the CFE (bootloader) web interface, refer https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/bo … tp_server.Just to summarize the steps,- Assigning static ip to your machine which is connected to router using a LAN cable- power off the router, press the reset, power on the router *keeping* the reset pressed, release after few seconds when the light goes red- Point your browser to 192.168.1.1 (remember to clear caches of browser if you have problems in accessing the page)- upload the firmware through the web interface, it will take few minutes and restart- Remove the static ip for your machine and configure to do DHCP and EnjoyLet me know if you have any specific questions. I will contact the developers and see how to add support for this router in the future with the correct name. (Last edited by yousuf on 16 Nov 2015, 01:22)

so i think this has something to do with why it wont save settings "Sun Sep  6 17:55:08 2015 daemon.err mount_root: no jffs2 marker found"its from the "dmesg; logread" after a rebootany other places i could look for answers?

So yousuf dident suply his hardware revision and there are - C1 - T1 and T3there is a major difference in the flash layout of the stock firmware and the suggested A4001Nbut it dose boot into failsafe modei have gone as far as compiling the openwrt from the source and have made FW that boots into failsafe as well - based on the platfrom and device mentioned by yousufbut i dont understand enough to change the flash layoutif anyone can help ill be glad to post any info i haveBuilt the latest openwrt Designated Driver Bleeding Edge from source with A400 1N spec and it saves settings.issues after installing Luci Wi-Fi - WPA and WPA2 not working - wpad-mini package installedin luci it wont scan for available networks - can setup basic network AP open authentication (Last edited by acdcat on 25 Dec 2015, 23:30)

Hi guys,I too am very interested in getting this device on the HCL for OpenWrt. I live in South Africa and these devices are in most peoples homes.DLink DSL2750U Hardware Rev T1.Please let me know if there is anything I can submit from the console that would aid in getting around this.I suspect it might be to do with the amount of memory the device has, this error I believe is related to the config not being saved as ACDCat mentioned.daemon.err mount_root: no jffs2 marker found

ok so this router has probably been branded differently in EU/USA/RU. and there are different H/W versionsDSL-2750U H/W T1 board id=96328angProfile=generic-96328avng-8M - 64K - jffs2.binpackages= b43, wpad-mini, + packages for extroot(blkid, block-mount,ext4-fs,usb-TESTING VARIOUS)if you use a jffs2 64k image and not a squashfs image there is no jffs2 errors.they dont have that image on the download section. so you have to build it and i coulden't get the chaos-calmmer15.1-imagebuilder to make a jffs2 image, so i used trunk source. root@OpenWrt:~# df -hFilesystem                Size      Used     Available    Use%  Mounted on/dev/root                 6.6M      4.2M      2.4M         64%       /tmpfs                    29.7M    536.0K     29.2M        2%       /tmptmpfs                   512.0K         0         512.0K       0%       /devroot@OpenWrt:~#its low on memory and usb not working ATM.But it saves setting and works as wi-fi repeater/extender/switch.

Developers recommend you use a squashfs image. That's the reason why the JFFS2 images are not built anymore.Install the official image, if you still get JFFS2 errors, telnet or SSH in and issue# mtd -r erase rootfs_data

ok so i have found out that there needs to be some kind off nvram erase or partition table reformatting... or in my case some kind of corruption...so i saw a "newwer" D-link firmware and was worried about usb not working so i loaded it.and usb works in stock firmwarebut when i try to re flash any (96328avng) - jffs2 or squashfs -8M.bin i get jffs2 errors block contained word..."(- mtd -r erase rootfs_data -)not working "soz bro"BUT then... i tryed to flash a 4M jffs2 image and it failed to flash constant red light.after that go back into CFE and flash jffs2 trunk and it saves setting again-EDIT: then it did the not allways booting up so i flashed a trunk image for 96328avng with only b42 and wpad-mini (no ext-root or usb drivers) squashfs.bin and its stable again...-hope that helps (Last edited by acdcat on 2 May 2016, 16:15)

Hi,
What would be the best way to detect the guest OS and then send the correct login credentials?
Thanks.

It depends...
Looking at the other drivers, would be a good starting point.
Most drivers look at the SSH banner (text shown pre login) and the password prompt. Of course there has to be something to distinguish your device from other devices.
If you post the text/output of an example login, I could try to help you.

I use telnet no SSH, but the principle must be the same I think...
I use this for the 3 routers I pretend to connect:
thomson/technicolor
_user_re
= [re.compile(r'sername : ', re.I)]
_password_re = [re.compile(r'assword : ', re.I)]
_prompt_re
= [re.compile(r'\{\w+\}\=\>', re.I)]
class ThomsonDriver(Driver):
def __init__(self):
Driver.__init__(self, 'thomson')
self.user_re
= _user_re
self.password_re = _password_re
self.prompt_re
= _prompt_re
def check_head_for_os(self, string):
if _user_re[0].search(string):
return 95
return 0
def init_terminal(self, conn):
conn.execute(':env set var=COLUMNS value=200')
ADB/Pirelli 4000
_user_re
= [re.compile(r'Login: ', re.I)]
_password_re = [re.compile(r'Password: ', re.I)]
_prompt_re
= [re.compile(r'[\r\n]?.*\>.*', re.M|re.S|re.I)]
class ADBPirelli4000Driver(Driver):
def __init__(self):
Driver.__init__(self, 'ADBPirelli4000')
self.user_re
= _user_re
self.password_re = _password_re
self.prompt_re
= _prompt_re
def check_head_for_os(self, string):
if _user_re[0].search(string):
return 95
return 0
ADB/Pirelli 1000
_user_re
= [re.compile(r'User Name : ', re.I)]
_password_re = [re.compile(r'User Password : ', re.I)]
_prompt_re
= [re.compile(r'(\w+) :\> ', re.M|re.S|re.I)]
class ADBPirelli1000Driver(Driver):
def __init__(self):
Driver.__init__(self, 'ADBPirelli1000')
self.user_re
= _user_re
self.password_re = _password_re
self.prompt_re
= _prompt_re
def check_head_for_os(self, string):
if _user_re[0].search(string):
return 70
return 0
What I pretend is to identify the routers so I can send the correct credentials, since they are different.
Thanks.

Writing drivers for exscript is about supporting devices, that aren't supported, yet. Exscript needs to know how prompts of a device (user, password, command line prompts) look like to support it.
If 2 devices work with the same driver, that would be perfectly fine.
For making automatic driver detection work, exscript additionally needs to know how to distinguish the device from others (especially in check_head_for_os).
You should know yourself (from a database?) which credentials to use at which device.
It would help a lot, if you could post the output / logs of a login to your devices. Please have a look at the existing banners:

The login is always different in this three, I have the drivers created, they seemed ok because if I do a successful login it gives the correct router name.
But for that I need to know each credentials to use, in a lab environment all have the same user/pass.
Thanks.

So you assign credentials based on device types? Do you know the ip and device type of each device? Exscript supports manually selecting the driver. That way you don't have to rely on os detection.
In most use cases you use the same credentials on every device you manage (i.e. the devices are configured to use Radius or something like that) or you know the credentials of each device (knowing the credentials based on the ip of the device).
Exscript has no method to bind account data based on the used driver.

@egroeper I only know the IP.
If you use the same credentials on every device that a big security hole, this way I can assure that if a device gets compromise, only a fraction is affected.
Thanks

Of course you could use different credentials based on the role a device has in your network. But I don't think the OS running on it is a useful criterion.
The more devices you have, the less it is feasible to make such things complex. You simply have other problems and need to implement other methods to make things secure.
