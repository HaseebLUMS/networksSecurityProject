What is 401 Unauthorized Error and how to fix it
RECOMMENDED: Click here to repair Windows problems & optimize system performance
401 Unauthorized Error is an HTTPS status error that may be encountered in any kind of browser like Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, etc. Basically, the error is displayed when there is a problem loading a webpage.
On an everyday basis, we stumble across several websites. We subscribe to many online services, news blogs and many other special offers by simply signing in to their page by linking to our social media accounts like Facebook or Google accounts. Moreover, linking user accounts from various identity providers essentially eases the process of authentication to the user and also help the sites to recognize the identity of users in granting website access. While its hard for us to remember the sites and services we have signed on the internet, our systems keep track of all those logins. This primarily offers hassle-free surfing experience with easy login access to the websites.
You may have come across an instance wherein you encounter 401 Unauthorised Access is denied due to invalid credentials error alert on logging into few websites. The 401 error message is usually displayed on the site that requires user credentials. So if you have got this error then it probably means you entered an invalid username or password.
However, there are cases wherein you encounter these faulty errors in spite of having a valid credential. Moreover, these errors may appear in different ways like 401 Unauthorized, HTTP Error 401- Unauthorised or Authorization Required; but they all mean the same. The error messages are often modified by websites and are displayed inside the browser depending on the website you log in. In this article, we will discuss the solutions to fix this error.
Fix 401 Unauthorized Error
Check for Invalid URL
Many a time it may happen that you give a wrong URL or you try to open the URL link which is reserved for only authorized users. In this scenario, The 401 error is displayed. So before you type any URL make sure that you give a valid address.
Invalid Login Credentials
It’s quite natural that remembering those large scales of passwords is outrightly a strenuous task. If you get the 401 error after login, then it means either a username or password you provided is invalid. In this case, use the website’s built-in password reset to set a new password and follow the process mentioned on the website. The process is easy if you had registered the website with a valid email address on the initial phase, else you may want to contact the website admin to regain the access.
Search for a Secure Accessing option in the website’s main page
If you have a valid URL name and you are still seeing the 401 error then it’s quite possible that you are not logged into the website. In this case, visit the website’s main page and search for an option that says ‘Secure Access’. Give your credentials on the login page and try to load the page. If you don’t have credentials then you may want to set up an account. This is done simply by following the instructions given on the website.
False Login Requisite by the Host server
While 401 error is a client-side error, a user error on the server side can result in a false login requirement. That is, the 401 error is displayed to anyone visiting the website by mistake.  For instance, at the server side, it may happen that the network administrator enables the login authentication to all the users even when it is not required. This causes a problem to normal website users as the error message is displayed to anyone visiting the site. The only way to resolve the problem, in this case, is to inform the website by contacting the website administrator.
Hope this helps!

HTTP Error 401 Unauthorized Explained
CheckUpDown
Tweet
HTTP Error 401 Unauthorized
What is Error 401
The Web server (running the Web site) thinks that the HTTP data stream sent by the client (e.g. your Web browser or our CheckUpDown robot) was correct, but access to the URL resource requires user authentication 1) which has not yet been provided or 2) which has been provided but failed authorization tests. This is commonly known as "HTTP Basic Authentication". The actual authentication request expected from the client is defined in the HTTP protocol as the WWW-Authenticate header field. (Last updated: March 2012).
Generally this error message means you need to log on (enter a valid user ID and password) somewhere first. If you have just entered these and then immediately see a 401 error, it means that one or both of your user ID and password were invalid for whatever reason (entered incorrectly, user ID suspended etc.).
Fixing 401 errors - general
Each Web Server manages user authentication in its own way. A security officer (e.g. a Web Master) at the site typically decides which users are allowed to access the URL. This person then uses Web server software to set up those users and their passwords. So if you need to access the URL (or you forgot your user ID or password), only the security officer at that site can help you. Refer any security issues direct to them.
If you think that the URL Web page *should* be accessible to all and sundry on the Internet, then a 401 message indicates a deeper problem. The first thing you can do is check your URL via a Web browser. This browser should be running on a computer to which you have never previously identified yourself in any way, and you should avoid authentication (passwords etc.) that you have used previously. Ideally all this should be done over a completely different Internet connection to any you have used before (e.g. a different ISP dial-up connection). In short, you are trying to get the same behaviour a total stranger would get if they surfed the Internet to the Web page.
If this type of browser check indicates no authority problems, then it is possible that the Web server (or surrounding systems) have been configured to disallow certain patterns of HTTP traffic. In other words, HTTP communication from a well-known Web browser is allowed, but automated communication from other systems is rejected with an 401 error code. This is unusual, but may indicate a very defensive security policy around the Web server.
Fixing 401 errors - CheckUpDown
Our service monitors your site for HTTP errors like 401. When you set up your CheckUpDown account, you may optionally provide two items 2. Web Site User ID and 3. Web Site Password. You should provide these only if the site uses HTTP Basic Authentication. If you provide them, the CheckUpDown robot always uses them. This will result in a 401 error if in fact the site does not use this authentication. Conversely, if you do not provide them and the site does use this authentication, you also get a 401 error.
If however your URL is open to all comers, then an 401 message should not appear. Because it indicates a fundamental authority problem, we can only resolve this by negotiation with the personnel responsible for security on and around the Web site. These discussions unfortunately may take some time, but can often be amicably resolved. You can assist by endorsing our service to the security personnel. Please contact us (email preferred) if you see persistent 401 errors, so that we can agree the best way to resolve them.
401 errors in the HTTP cycle
Any client (e.g. your Web browser or our CheckUpDown robot) goes through the following cycle when it communicates with the Web server:
Obtain an IP address from the IP name of the site (the site URL without the leading 'http://'). This lookup (conversion of IP name to IP address) is provided by domain name servers (DNSs).
Open an IP socket connection to that IP address.
Write an HTTP data stream through that socket.
Receive an HTTP data stream back from the Web server in response. This data stream contains status codes whose values are determined by the HTTP protocol. Parse this data stream for status codes and other useful information.
This error occurs in the final step above when the client receives an HTTP status code that it recognises as '401'.
Most Common HTTP Errors
403 - Forbidden
404 - Not Found
500 - Internal Server Error
502 - Bad Gateway
503 - Service Unavailable

Alas, we are not, and thus error messages like “401 Unauthorized Access” are still something that most do not know how to solve. We’ve become fairly adept at taking apart and explaining many of the various error messages that inhabit your online lifestyle, and this is another that we’re going to lay out in front of you. If this is something that you’ve run into fairly frequently while browsing, you’re going to get some knowledge about why you’re running into it, and how to resolve it.Let’s face it — we’re all probably subscribed to too many newsletters, way too many websites, and more “special offers” than we could ever remember. And that’s not even beginning to delve into all of the sites and services that we’ve signed into simply by linking them to our social media accounts. Sometimes, Facebook can seem like a master key to the internet, right? But even though we can’t keep track of those, our computers do. And those sites that require a specific username and password in order to get you access don’t really have a workaround. That’s a good thing, after all; we want our internet to remain as safe and secure as possible.This particular error message can manifest in a number of ways, but it’s usually just a “401 Unauthorized” tag splashed across a blank background in your web browser. It almost always shows up after you’ve tried accessing a site or service that usually requires an username and password. When you get it wrong (or don’t have it in the first place) this error message shows up.However, there are occasions when you do have the right login information, but for some reason, you’re unable to access the site as per usual. It’s primarily these situations that we’re hoping to address, today. Because the internet is a complex thing, and security can be tantamount to jumping through five flaming hoops at a circus, it’s understandable that people sometimes run into this error message, be it by their own fault with the wrong login info, or something that needs to be resolved by the website’s administrator.HTTP Status CodesThough error codes might seem like snippets snatched from the pages of technical wizardry, they’re anything but. For those who would like to take the time to learn how to understand them, it’s not a difficult process. And even the most basic understanding can help you to navigate through problems that might have otherwise left you confused and worried.We can start to break this down by looking at the two primary parties responsible for getting you to the websites that you want to visit (and no, I’m not about to get political on you.) Though there’s more to it than this, it’s helpful to see things as either client-side or server-side. The “client” is essentially you, your web browser, your computer, and the hardware that you’re using to connect to the internet, such as a modem and router. The “server” is responsible for hosting the content that you’re trying to reach, as well as maintaining the certificates and security standards in place to determine whether or not you have access to it.“Using the HTTP protocol, computer scientists around the world began making the Internet easier to navigate by inventing point-and-click browsers. One browser in particular, called Mosaic, created in 1993 at the University of Illinois, would help popularize the Web, and therefore the Net, as no software too had yet done.”- Katie HafnerKnowing this, we can better understand two very common types of online error codes. 4xx error messages (anything in the 400s) are specifically client errors. This means that you, your browser, your computer, or your connected hardware have failed to perform some necessary step required to access particular web content. It might be the wrong username and password, or it might be something in your hardware configuration that needs to be changed. It could even be a connectivity error.5xx error messages (anything in the 500s) are server errors. This means that the fault is very likely not with you, but with the host server for the website or service not responding properly. In these instances, there’s very little that you can do, apart from contacting the site’s administrators.ALSO READ:  6 Fixes For Error 503 Backend Fetch Failed401 UnauthorizedAll of this doesn’t necessary help to make the “401 Unauthorized” error any easier to swallow, however. It’s still a pain in the butt, and there are still several different reasons that it can show up, in the first place.Invalid URL: It’s quite possible that you’ve entered the wrong URL for the website or service that you’re trying to access. Make sure that it’s accurate!Not Logged In: If you’re trying to access a part of a site that requires you to be securely logged in with registered login information, you’ll get a 401 error.Invalid Login Credentials: If your login credentials are incorrect, you’re probably going to get a 401 error.False Login Requirement: This one’s tricky; if a site shouldn’t require login information, but for some reason appears to, it might be the fault of the site’s administrator. While this is an error that clearly takes place on the server side of things, it’s registering as a client-side error. Hence, you’ll see the 401 Unauthorized message.DNS Errors: In some rare circumstances, it’s possible that DNS lookup errors can prompt a 401 message.There are a few other outliers, but these are far and away the most likely culprits for your 401 Unauthorized error message. Below, we’re going to move through each of them, and help you to work around this particularly troublesome obstacle.Resolving the Error MessageThankfully, the steps necessary to resolve any of these situations is fairly easy. Using the above information, determine which is the most likely scenario for you, and then take a look at our possible solutions.Invalid URLThis one might seem like a bit of a no-brainer, but if you’re manually entering URLs, it’s quite possible that you might have simply entered it incorrectly. Either that or the link that you’ve bookmarked — usually part of a site that’s behind login requirements — no longer exists. If the URL is entered correctly, then make sure that you’re trying to access part of the site or service that’s available before you’ve logged in.Not Logged InTangentially related to the above problem, it’s possible that you’re seeing the 401 Unauthorized message because you’re not logged into the site or service. Just as above, you’re going to want to navigate to the part of the site, either by way of links or an URL, that allows you to securely log in. Most website landing pages give you a place to do this.Make sure that you have the correct username and password for the site, enter them, and then try again. Once you’re logged into the site itself, you should be able to navigate to any part of it that you have access to, without any trouble.If you’re having computer trouble, it could be worth trying out Advanced SystemCare (click to learn more). CNET describes it as a “Swiss Army Knife of a PC utility“. Once you download it, you get a suite of optimization tools, including an uninstaller, one-click registry fixes, defragmenters, and more.Invalid Login CredentialsMost 401 Unauthorized errors come as a result of this particular problem, and there are quite a few reasons for that. First, it’s very easy to misremember login information in the first place. We’re encouraged to use passwords that are entirely random — not recognizable phrases or words. Thus, without a strong password management application (I’ll recommend a couple, below) it’s possible that you’re not going to remember all of your passwords. If you’re unable to log in without getting a 401 Unauthorized error, use the site’s built-in “Password Reset” feature to choose a new password. As long as you’re registered with the site by way of an email address, this should be easy. If a more complicated process is required, contact the site’s administrator.Try it again, after ensuring that your login information is correct, and you should be able to move right past the error message. Meanwhile, consider using a password data management app like LastPass, LogMeOnce, or Keeper.False Login RequirementAs mentioned above, here’s a tricky problem to have, when you run into that 401 Unauthorized error message. Even though 4xx errors are client-side, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the origin of the large problem isn’t coming from the website’s host server.Here’s how it might work out — a network administrator for a particular site accidentally enables login authentication where none should be required. Suddenly, websites that were normally accessible to people who weren’t logged in, are spitting out 401 Unauthorized messages to anyone that attempts it. Technically, it is a client-side error, since the site is programmed to require login information. But since that requirement is a result of user error on the server side, the only way to effectively resolve it is to wait for it to be remedied by the site administrators.ALSO READ:  The 20+ Best Masterani.me Alternatives | Plus Master Anime Shutdown BackstoryAnd as before, when it comes down to those running the host server, the best thing to do is contact them directly.DNS ErrorsIt’s rare that DNS errors actually prompt a 401 Unauthorized error in your browser, but it’s not entirely unheard of. Either way, flushing the DNS is easy to do, and often advised if you want to regularly maintain your internet service.In Windows open the Command Prompt with Administrator access. Simply type in cmd.exe in the Windows Search bar, and ensure that you select the option of running it as the computer’s administrator. Once the Command Prompt has opened, type in ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter. See? Easy as pie.In Mac OS X, the process is slightly different. Open up the Command Terminal, and then type in sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder. This will flush the DNS, and in rare circumstances, allow you to proceed past a 401 Unauthorized error that has no other apparent cause.Hopefully, our steps above have helped you to fix the errors that are keeping you from your web content. the 401 Unauthorized error can easily leave users stumped, without any clear path on how to solve it.

May 5, 2018 at 1:44 pm
| ReplyI’m trying to enter my company’s employee portal.
For some reason, using Internet Explorer (preferred by company) I can get in just fine on the company issued laptop but, again using IE, I can’t get in using my PERSONAL laptop.
However… I CAN get in using my personal laptop via Firefox, as well as on my iOS devices (Safari.)So, there’s something going on between my personal laptop, IE, and the company portal.
Interestingly, when I attempt to get on the site using my personal laptop and IE, it actually shows the page of the site that comes up AFTER the log in.
And, it indicates that I am already logged in BUT it shows that “Kenneth” is logged in and every bit of data I have with this company shows me as “Ken.”
When I log in any other way it says “Welcome Ken.”
But in this scenario (personal laptop, IE) It shows me as Kenneth and says something like “Unauthorized Access.
You do not have correct security to access this portal….”Again, it indicates that I am already logged in (with incorrect name).
If I try clicking on the “Log Out” button, nothing happens.It’s really strange and frustrating.
Our tech services is not much help because they’re not allowed to support our personal equipment, even though we are allowed to conduct company business with it.I can just access the portal all the time with Mozella except, for some reason, all the payroll functions don’t fully work with Mozella.I’ve run a complete Kaspersky scan and nothing nefarious came up.Leave a Comment Cancel replyCommentName Email Website

What is Error 401?The
Web server (running the website) thinks that the HTTP data stream sent by the
client (e.g. your browser or our Check Up Down robot) was correct, however access
to the address resource needs user authentication 1) that has not however been
provided or that has been provided however failing authorization tests. This is
often unremarkable referred to as “HTTP Basic Authentication." The
particular authentication request expected from the client is outlined within
the HTTP protocol because the WWW-Authenticate header field. (Last updated:
March 2012). Generally this error message suggests that you wish to go online
(enter a sound user ID and password) somewhere 1st. If you have got simply
entered these then straight off see a 401 unauthorized error, it means one or each of your
user ID and word were invalid for no matter reason (entered incorrectly, user
ID suspended etc.).401 unauthorized  errors  general:Each
internet Server manages user authentication in its own means. A security
officer (e.g. an online Master) in the positioning generally decides that users
square measure allowed to access the address. This person then uses internet
server package to line up those users and their passwords. thus, if you wish to
access the address (or you forgot your user ID or password), solely the
protection officer at that website will assist you. Refer any security problems
direct to them. If you think that the URL website *should* be accessible to any
or all and varied on the web, then a 401 messages indicates a deeper drawback. The
primary issue you'll do is check your URL via an online browser. This browser
ought tone running on a laptop to that you have got ne'er antecedent know
yourself in any means, and you ought to avoid authentication (passwords etc.)
that you just have used antecedent. Ideally
all this could be done over a totally completely different web association to
any you have got used before (e.g. a unique ISP dial-up connection). In short,
you're attempting to urge a similar behaviour a complete unknown would get
if they surfed the web to the online page. If this somewhat browser
check indicates no authority issues, then it's potential that the web server
(or encompassing systems) are designed to forbid bound patterns of HTTP
traffic. In different words, HTTP communication from a widely known
browser is allowed, however machine-controlled communication from
different systems is rejected with AN 401 unauthorized error code. This is often
uncommon, however might indicate an awfully defensive
security policy round the internet server.Fix 401 Unauthorized Error types are:Check for Invalid URL: Many a time it should happen that you just
provides a wrong uniform resource locator otherwise you attempt to open the URL
link that is reserved for under approved users. During this state of affairs,
The 401 error is displayed. thus before you kind any URL make certain that you
just provides a valid address. Invalid Login Credentials It’ quite
natural that basic cognitive process those giant scales of passwords be out
rightly a strenuous task. If you get the 401 error when login, then it means
that either a username or arcane you provided is invalid. During this case, use
website|the website}’ intrinsic arcane reset to line a replacement arcanum and
follow the method mentioned on the website. The method is straightforward if
you had registered the website with a legitimate email address on the initial
part, else you'll need to contact the website admin to regain the access.Search for
a Secure Accessing choice within the website’s main page: you've got a legitimate uniform resource
locator name and you're still seeing the 401 error then it’ quite attainable
that you just don't seem to be logged into the website. During this case, visit
the website’s main page And look for a choice that says ‘Secure Access’. Offer
your credentials on the login page and take a look at to load the
page. If you don’t have credentials then you'll need to lineup AN
account. This can be done just by following the directions given on the
website. False Login Requisite by the Host are while:401
error could be a client-side error, a user error on the server facet may result
in an exceedingly false login demand. That is, the 401 error is
exhibited to anyone visiting the website by
mistake. For example, at the server facet, it should happen that the
network administrator allows the login authentication to all or any the users
even once it's not needed. This causes a haul to traditional web site
users because the error message is exhibited to anyone visiting the positioning. The sole
thanks to resolve the matter, during this case, are to tell
the website by contacting the website administrator.

Error 401 occurs when trying to access Administrative and Help-Desk Portals, while Self-Service Portal works fine.
This error is returned by Internet Information Services (IIS). It occurs when the authentication to Admin or Helpdesk portal fails. Administrative and Helpdesk portals have similar authentication settings, Self-Service portal has different, that is why the Self-Service portal does not return this error.
Authentication can fail because authentication settings are misconfigured or the account does not have read permissions to the physical folder on the server.
To resolve the issue verify authentication settings and account permisions.
1. Make sure all authentication types except Windows authentication or Basic authentication are disabled in Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager, and either Windows or Basic authentication is enabled.
To ensure the required settings are enabled in IIS6, do the following:
In IIS Manager left pane, navigate to <your computer name> – Web Sites – Default Web Site – PM.
Right-click the helpdesk (or admin) virtual directory under
PM folder and select Properties.
In the Properties dialog, open the Directory Security tab, and select Edit for Authentication and access control.
In the Authentication Methods dialog, enable either the Integrated Windows authentication box or Basic authentication (password is sent in clear text), and clear all other authentication options for Authentication access.
To ensure the required settings are enabled in IIS7, do the following:
In IIS Manager left pane, navigate to <your computer name> – Web Sites – Default Web Site – PM – helpdesk (or admin)
In the Manager central pane, double-click the Authentication option under IIS block
In the Authentication list, enable either Windows Authentication option or Basic Authentication, and disable all other authentication options.
2. The account whose credentials are specified to access the portal has Read permisison to the Password Manager instalaltion directory
3. The account is granted the appropriate role: Administrators role to access Administrative portal and Help Desk Operators role to access Help Desk portal.

This happens generally due to protocol requirements, and not specific to SWG appliance or software!
Solution
In order to resolve this issue, the login credentials must be included in the URL in the following format: ftp://username:password@ftp.adress.com
Software Version
general protocol requirement, not related to any SWG version
This article applies to:
all SWG appliances

vteThis is a list of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response status codes. Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. It includes codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in some common applications of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses. The message phrases shown are typical, but any human-readable alternative may be provided. Unless otherwise stated, the status code is part of the HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 7231).[1]
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the official registry of HTTP status codes.[2]
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) sometimes uses additional decimal sub-codes for more specific information,[3] however these sub-codes only appear in the response payload and in documentation, not in the place of an actual HTTP status code.
All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes (or categories). The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any class or categorization role. There are five values for the first digit:
1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood and accepted
3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

1xx Informational response[edit]
An informational response indicates that the request was received and understood. It is issued on a provisional basis while request processing continues. It alerts the client to wait for a final response. The message consists only of the status line and optional header fields, and is terminated by an empty line. As the HTTP/1.0 standard did not define any 1xx status codes, servers must not[note 1] send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 compliant client except under experimental conditions.[4]
100 Continue
The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). Sending a large request body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be inefficient. To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending the body. If the client receives an error code such as 403 (Forbidden) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) then it shouldn't send the request's body. The response 417 Expectation Failed indicates that the request should be repeated without the Expect header as it indicates that the server doesn't support expectations (this is the case, for example, of HTTP/1.0 servers).[5]
101 Switching Protocols
The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so.[6]
102 Processing (WebDAV; RFC 2518)
A WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, requiring a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.[7] This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.
103 Early Hints (RFC 8297)
Used to return some response headers before final HTTP message.[8]
2xx Success[edit]
This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood and accepted.[2]
200 OK
Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.[9]
201 Created
The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.[10]
202 Accepted
The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs.[11]
203 Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1)
The server is a transforming proxy (e.g. a Web accelerator) that received a 200 OK from its origin, but is returning a modified version of the origin's response.[12][13]
204 No Content
The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.[14]
205 Reset Content
The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view.[15]
206 Partial Content (RFC 7233)
The server is delivering only part of the resource (byte serving) due to a range header sent by the client. The range header is used by HTTP clients to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams.[16]
207 Multi-Status (WebDAV; RFC 4918)
The message body that follows is by default an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made.[17]
208 Already Reported (WebDAV; RFC 5842)
The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a preceding part of the (multistatus) response, and are not being included again.
226 IM Used (RFC 3229)
The server has fulfilled a request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.[18]
3xx Redirection[edit]
This class of status code indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request. Many of these status codes are used in URL redirection.[2]
A user agent may carry out the additional action with no user interaction only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent may automatically redirect a request. A user agent should detect and intervene to prevent cyclical redirects.[19]
300 Multiple Choices
Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose (via agent-driven content negotiation). For example, this code could be used to present multiple video format options, to list files with different filename extensions, or to suggest word-sense disambiguation.[20]
301 Moved Permanently
This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.[21]
302 Found (Previously "Moved temporarily")
Tells the client to look at (browse to) another URL. 302 has been superseded by 303 and 307. This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"),[22] but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.[23] However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.[24]
303 See Other (since HTTP/1.1)
The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), the client should presume that the server has received the data and should issue a new GET request to the given URI.[25]
304 Not Modified (RFC 7232)
Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.[26]
305 Use Proxy (since HTTP/1.1)
The requested resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is provided in the response. For security reasons, many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer) do not obey this status code.[27]
306 Switch Proxy
No longer used. Originally meant "Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy."[28]
307 Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1)
In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests should still use the original URI. In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not allowed to be changed when reissuing the original request. For example, a POST request should be repeated using another POST request.[29]
308 Permanent Redirect (RFC 7538)
The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. 307 and 308 parallel the behaviors of 302 and 301, but do not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.[30]
4xx Client errors[edit]
404 error on Wikipedia
This class of status code is intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included entity to the user.[31]
400 Bad Request
The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).[32]
401 Unauthorized (RFC 7235)
Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication.[33] 401 semantically means "unauthorised"[34], the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
Note: Some sites incorrectly issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific address is refused permission to access a website.
402 Payment Required
Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed, for example, by GNU Taler,[35] but that has not yet happened, and this code is not usually used. Google Developers API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests.[36] Sipgate uses this code if an account does not have sufficient funds to start a call.[37] Shopify uses this code when the store has not paid their fees and is temporarily disabled.[38]
403 Forbidden
The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. The user might not have the necessary permissions for a resource, or may need an account of some sort. This code is also typically used if the request provided authentication via the WWW-Authenticate header field, but the server did not accept that authentication.
404 Not Found
The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
405 Method Not Allowed
A request method is not supported for the requested resource; for example, a GET request on a form that requires data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource.
406 Not Acceptable
The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.[39] See Content negotiation.
407 Proxy Authentication Required (RFC 7235)
The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.[40]
408 Request Timeout
The server timed out waiting for the request. According to HTTP specifications: "The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time."[41]
409 Conflict
Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the current state of the resource, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates.
410 Gone
Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices.[42] Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead.
411 Length Required
The request did not specify the length of its content, which is required by the requested resource.[43]
412 Precondition Failed (RFC 7232)
The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request header fields.[44] [45]
413 Payload Too Large (RFC 7231)
The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process. Previously called "Request Entity Too Large".[46]
414 URI Too Long (RFC 7231)
The URI provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being encoded as a query-string of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request.[47] Called "Request-URI Too Long" previously.[48]
415 Unsupported Media Type (RFC 7231)
The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support.
For example, the client uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format.[49]
416 Range Not Satisfiable (RFC 7233)
The client has asked for a portion of the file (byte serving), but the server cannot supply that portion. For example, if the client asked for a part of the file that lies beyond the end of the file.[50] Called "Requested Range Not Satisfiable" previously.[51]
417 Expectation Failed
The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.[52]
418 I'm a teapot (RFC 2324, RFC 7168)
This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers.
The RFC specifies this code should be returned by teapots requested to brew coffee.[53] This HTTP status is used as an Easter egg in some websites, including Google.com.[54][55]
421 Misdirected Request (RFC 7540)
The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response[56]
(for example because of connection reuse).[57]
422 Unprocessable Entity (WebDAV; RFC 4918)
The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.[17]
423 Locked (WebDAV; RFC 4918)
The resource that is being accessed is locked.[17]
424 Failed Dependency (WebDAV; RFC 4918)
The request failed because it depended on another request and that request failed (e.g., a PROPPATCH).[17]
425 Too Early (RFC 8470)
Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed.
426 Upgrade Required
The client should switch to a different protocol such as TLS/1.0, given in the Upgrade header field.[58]
428 Precondition Required (RFC 6585)
The origin server requires the request to be conditional. Intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.[59]
429 Too Many Requests (RFC 6585)
The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. Intended for use with rate-limiting schemes.[59]
431 Request Header Fields Too Large (RFC 6585)
The server is unwilling to process the request because either an individual header field, or all the header fields collectively, are too large.[59]
451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons (RFC 7725)
A server operator has received a legal demand to deny access to a resource or to a set of resources that includes the requested resource.[60] The code 451 was chosen as a reference to the novel Fahrenheit 451 (see the Acknowledgements in the RFC).
5xx Server errors[edit]
The server failed to fulfill a request.[61]
Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. Likewise, user agents should display any included entity to the user. These response codes are applicable to any request method.[62]
500 Internal Server Error
A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.[63]
501 Not Implemented
The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request. Usually this implies future availability (e.g., a new feature of a web-service API).[64]
502 Bad Gateway
The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.[65]
503 Service Unavailable
The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state.[66]
504 Gateway Timeout
The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.[67]
505 HTTP Version Not Supported
The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.[68]
506 Variant Also Negotiates (RFC 2295)
Transparent content negotiation for the request results in a circular reference.[69]
507 Insufficient Storage (WebDAV; RFC 4918)
The server is unable to store the representation needed to complete the request.[17]
508 Loop Detected (WebDAV; RFC 5842)
The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request (sent instead of 208 Already Reported).
510 Not Extended (RFC 2774)
Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfil it.[70]
511 Network Authentication Required (RFC 6585)
The client needs to authenticate to gain network access. Intended for use by intercepting proxies used to control access to the network (e.g., "captive portals" used to require agreement to Terms of Service before granting full Internet access via a Wi-Fi hotspot).[59]
Unofficial codes[edit]
The following codes are not specified by any standard.
103 Checkpoint
Used in the resumable requests proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests.[71]
218 This is fine (Apache Web Server)
Used as a catch-all error condition for allowing response bodies to flow through Apache when ProxyErrorOverride is enabled. When ProxyErrorOverride is enabled in Apache, response bodies that contain a status code of 4xx or 5xx are automatically discarded by Apache in favor of a generic response or a custom response specified by the ErrorDocument directive.[72]
419 Page Expired (Laravel Framework)
Used by the Laravel Framework when a CSRF Token is missing or expired.
420 Method Failure (Spring Framework)
A deprecated response used by the Spring Framework when a method has failed.[73]
420 Enhance Your Calm (Twitter)
Returned by version 1 of the Twitter Search and Trends API when the client is being rate limited; versions 1.1 and later use the 429 Too Many Requests response code instead.[74]
450 Blocked by Windows Parental Controls (Microsoft)
The Microsoft extension code indicated when Windows Parental Controls are turned on and are blocking access to the requested webpage.[75]
498 Invalid Token (Esri)
Returned by ArcGIS for Server. Code 498 indicates an expired or otherwise invalid token.[76]
499 Token Required (Esri)
Returned by ArcGIS for Server. Code 499 indicates that a token is required but was not submitted.[76]
509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded (Apache Web Server/cPanel)
The server has exceeded the bandwidth specified by the server administrator; this is often used by shared hosting providers to limit the bandwidth of customers.[77]
526 Invalid SSL Certificate
Used by Cloudflare and Cloud Foundry's gorouter to indicate failure to validate the SSL/TLS certificate that the origin server presented.
530 Site is frozen
Used by the Pantheon web platform to indicate a site that has been frozen due to inactivity.[78]
598 (Informal convention) Network read timeout error
Used by some HTTP proxies to signal a network read timeout behind the proxy to a client in front of the proxy.[79]
Internet Information Services[edit]
Microsoft's Internet Information Services web server expands the 4xx error space to signal errors with the client's request.
440 Login Time-out
The client's session has expired and must log in again.[80]
449 Retry With
The server cannot honour the request because the user has not provided the required information.[81]
451 Redirect
Used in Exchange ActiveSync when either a more efficient server is available or the server cannot access the users' mailbox.[82] The client is expected to re-run the HTTP AutoDiscover operation to find a more appropriate server.[83]
nginx[edit]
The nginx web server software expands the 4xx error space to signal issues with the client's request.[84][85]
444 No Response
Used internally[86] to instruct the server to return no information to the client and close the connection immediately.
494 Request header too large
Client sent too large request or too long header line.
495 SSL Certificate Error
An expansion of the 400 Bad Request response code, used when the client has provided an invalid client certificate.
496 SSL Certificate Required
An expansion of the 400 Bad Request response code, used when a client certificate is required but not provided.
497 HTTP Request Sent to HTTPS Port
An expansion of the 400 Bad Request response code, used when the client has made a HTTP request to a port listening for HTTPS requests.
499 Client Closed Request
Used when the client has closed the request before the server could send a response.
Cloudflare[edit]
Cloudflare's reverse proxy service expands the 5xx series of errors space to signal issues with the origin server.[87]
520 Unknown Error
The 520 error is used as a "catch-all response for when the origin server returns something unexpected", listing connection resets, large headers, and empty or invalid responses as common triggers.
521 Web Server Is Down
The origin server has refused the connection from Cloudflare.
522 Connection Timed Out
Cloudflare could not negotiate a TCP handshake with the origin server.
523 Origin Is Unreachable
Cloudflare could not reach the origin server; for example, if the DNS records for the origin server are incorrect.
524 A Timeout Occurred
Cloudflare was able to complete a TCP connection to the origin server, but did not receive a timely HTTP response.
525 SSL Handshake Failed
Cloudflare could not negotiate a SSL/TLS handshake with the origin server.
526 Invalid SSL Certificate
Cloudflare could not validate the SSL certificate on the origin web server.
527 Railgun Error
Error 527 indicates that the request timed out or failed after the WAN connection had been established.[88]
530 Origin DNS Error
Error 530 indicates that the requested host name could not be resolved on the Cloudflare network to an origin server.[89]

Also , worth checking CONTENTSERVER ( tcode SICF -- /default_host/sap/bc/ ) logon data.
We had the same issue ( HTTP error : 401 Unauthorized , while trying to create a document using tcode OAAD) and the problem appears to be with the contentserver service (tcode SICF) logon data user/password info being incorrect.
Regards,
Vimal.

The key here is that you changed the CS revision level or updated the patch level which can make CS have trouble with the existing certificates. See note 1800664 for instructions in deleting, resending, and reactivating your certificates.

On the content server, go to adminsecurity and set it to zero.
this is found in the contentserver.ini file in the content server directory.
Please reward if useful.

yeah it was already set on "0"
antoher problem i think. every time when i click on "CS Admin" inside the repository (OAC0) i need a username and password ( clickhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/1958/userzp2.jpg">click> ). i always use a system account who is local administrator and after that i can access the repository settings. This" target="_blank">http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/1982/csinizi2.jpg">This is my CS.ini. I set the security on "0" too but always the 401. Is there a need to open antoher port beside the default 1090? Because http is working on 80 and i know that every port must be opened for that server. Or do i need antoher user for that CS.
If you need other informations, just ask!
Thanks

Patrick

Most common reason I have encountered for this problem is authorizations on installation. You must have both network and local machine admin rights when installing content server software. If you don't, the installation will be successful but you encounter the 401 error. Try reinstalling with correct authorization and you should resolve the issue.

Hi Hardik Gandhi :
enter the t-code OAC0, click the Admin button.
select Settings tab, setting the filed security as "0",
select Certificates tab, click the certificate button, then system may telling you enter the username and password of your dms server,
and then click the active button , save these settings.

Hi, I am also having this 401 problem and i noticed in the above thread that network rights on installation were needed.
"Most common reason I have encountered for this problem is authorizations on installation. You must have both network and local machine admin rights when installing content server software. If you don't, the installation will be successful but you encounter the 401 error. Try reinstalling with correct authorization and you should resolve the issue."
Do you know where these would be set? Is this done on the server or is it done in the network?
Thanks
Rich

Dear All,
Certificate issue will also cause same situations like this.
Just select the content repository (Tcode: cdadmin) and go to certificate tab and check whether the correct certificate is assigned .
Regards,
Shanaka.

Hi, I saw your another issue #2684 which was opened 46 minutes after this one. Can you still reproduce this problem? Or can we consider it some kind of temporary error? I can't reproduce this on my side.

For everyone still bugged by this problem please ensure that you're using the same version of rclone in each place. You can check the version of rclone by running rclone -V. If you're using the same version of rclone but the version number is < 1.44, please also update them to the latest release.

What is 401 Unauthorized Error and how to fix it
RECOMMENDED: Click here to repair Windows problems & optimize system performance
401 Unauthorized Error is an HTTPS status error that may be encountered in any kind of browser like Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, etc. Basically, the error is displayed when there is a problem loading a webpage.
On an everyday basis, we stumble across several websites. We subscribe to many online services, news blogs and many other special offers by simply signing in to their page by linking to our social media accounts like Facebook or Google accounts. Moreover, linking user accounts from various identity providers essentially eases the process of authentication to the user and also help the sites to recognize the identity of users in granting website access. While its hard for us to remember the sites and services we have signed on the internet, our systems keep track of all those logins. This primarily offers hassle-free surfing experience with easy login access to the websites.
You may have come across an instance wherein you encounter 401 Unauthorised Access is denied due to invalid credentials error alert on logging into few websites. The 401 error message is usually displayed on the site that requires user credentials. So if you have got this error then it probably means you entered an invalid username or password.
However, there are cases wherein you encounter these faulty errors in spite of having a valid credential. Moreover, these errors may appear in different ways like 401 Unauthorized, HTTP Error 401- Unauthorised or Authorization Required; but they all mean the same. The error messages are often modified by websites and are displayed inside the browser depending on the website you log in. In this article, we will discuss the solutions to fix this error.
Fix 401 Unauthorized Error
Check for Invalid URL
Many a time it may happen that you give a wrong URL or you try to open the URL link which is reserved for only authorized users. In this scenario, The 401 error is displayed. So before you type any URL make sure that you give a valid address.
Invalid Login Credentials
It’s quite natural that remembering those large scales of passwords is outrightly a strenuous task. If you get the 401 error after login, then it means either a username or password you provided is invalid. In this case, use the website’s built-in password reset to set a new password and follow the process mentioned on the website. The process is easy if you had registered the website with a valid email address on the initial phase, else you may want to contact the website admin to regain the access.
Search for a Secure Accessing option in the website’s main page
If you have a valid URL name and you are still seeing the 401 error then it’s quite possible that you are not logged into the website. In this case, visit the website’s main page and search for an option that says ‘Secure Access’. Give your credentials on the login page and try to load the page. If you don’t have credentials then you may want to set up an account. This is done simply by following the instructions given on the website.
False Login Requisite by the Host server
While 401 error is a client-side error, a user error on the server side can result in a false login requirement. That is, the 401 error is displayed to anyone visiting the website by mistake.  For instance, at the server side, it may happen that the network administrator enables the login authentication to all the users even when it is not required. This causes a problem to normal website users as the error message is displayed to anyone visiting the site. The only way to resolve the problem, in this case, is to inform the website by contacting the website administrator.
Hope this helps!
