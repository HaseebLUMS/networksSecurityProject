Reviewing ASUS RT-AC58U - Is it a top-notch AC1300 wireless router?
Review by Ciprian Adrian Rusen

3 out of 5 stars
ASUS RT-AC58U AC1300 is a new router that aims to compete in the crowded space of wireless routers that cost somewhere between 100 and 150 USD. It stands out because it includes a new quad-core processor that is included in very few routers. This processor is industry's first single-chip Wi-Fi system-on-chip to bring Wave-2 802.11ac features that were standardized in 2016. In theory, we should get amazing performance at an affordable price. But does this router deliver on this promise? Let's find out from this review:
Unboxing the ASUS RT-AC58U AC1300 dual-band wireless router
The ASUS RT-AC58U AC1300 dual-band router comes in a simple box with a picture of the device on the top and a list with some of its most important features: the total maximum theoretical bandwidth, its support for 3G/4G dongles and so on.
Where To BuyBuy nowBuy nowBuy now
On the back side of the box you will find a description of its main features, including its quad-core processor, improved wireless range and so on. When you open the box, inside you will find the following: the router, the power adapter, a support disc, the warranty, a quick start guide and a network cable.
The unboxing experience offered by the ASUS RT-AC58U AC1300 wireless router is quick and pleasant. Inside the box you will find all the elements you would expect from a WiFi router.
Hardware specifications and design
ASUS RT-AC58U is a wireless router with four external antennas. As you can see in the picture below, they are very tall and they cannot be unscrewed from the router, which may be a downside for some users. The antennas are used for delivering MU-MIMO wireless connections which means fast and stable connections for devices that support this technology. Two of them are used for the 2.4 GHz wireless frequency and the other two for the 5 GHz frequency.
ASUS RT-AC58U is one of the first wireless routers to feature a quad-core Qualcomm IPQ4018 processor, running at 717 MHz. This processor is the industry's first single-chip Wi-Fi system-on-chip (SoC) to bring Wave-2 802.11ac features. The processor is complemented by 128 MB of RAM memory and 128 MB of storage space for the firmware and the software features of this router. Obviously, this router offers support for all the modern networking standards, including 802.11ac and 802.11n.
On the back side of the router, we have the WAN port alongside four Gigabit Ethernet ports, the WPS button, the power jack, a button for turning the router On and Off, and a jack for resetting the settings of the ASUS RT-AC58U.
On the front side of the router we can find the usual LED lights that indicate the status of the router's functioning and a USB 3.0 port.
The size of this router is quite small, at 8.1 x 5.8 x 1x4 inches or 207 x 148.8 x 35.5 mm in Length, Width and Height. ASUS RT-AC58U weighs only 395 grams or 13.93 ounces.
If you want to learn more about the characteristics of this wireless router, read its official web page: ASUS RT-AC58U Specifications.
Setting up and using the ASUS RT-AC58U AC1300 dual-band wireless router
One of the first things we noticed is that the ASUS RT-AC58U cannot be easily mounted on walls and other surfaces, since it doesn't have a VESA mount on the bottom.
To ensure the best wireless signal, you should place it on a flat surface and orient the four antennas as shown in the drawing below.
The firmware setup is easy and quick, just like on any other ASUS wireless router. First, you need to change the default username and password for administering the device, which is a great security precaution. Then, the router detects the type of your internet connection and it requests the appropriate connection details.
After you provide them, you are asked to set up the two wireless networks that are broadcast by the router.
At the end of the initial setup, you are shown a summary of your settings. You can access the administration user interface and get into more advanced settings, which we recommend you do. One new feature that we observed on the Network Map for this router, is the Status tab, where you can see how much of your router's processor cores and RAM memory are used. It's a neat little feature that can be useful when troubleshooting problems. Also, you can quickly tell when you have enabled too many features and they end up using too much of its hardware resources.
The user interface is neatly organized and easy to navigate. As always, ASUS provides great multilingual support. Below you can see the 18 languages in which you can use the administration interface.
All the settings are very well organized and you can easily find what you are looking for. One neat little feature is that help is easily available: if you don't understand what a setting does, move the mouse cursor on top of its name and, if you see a question mark displayed, click the left mouse button. Then, a tooltip is shown with more information about that setting.
As always with ASUS routers, advanced users will be pleased by the level of control they get. All the features of this router can be customized in detail and, by default, only the basic services are turned on, so that they don't consume precious resources.
When you are done setting everything, you should connect all your computers and devices to the network. This process is quick and easy. We were able to immediately share files and folders over the network, do media streaming, install a wireless printer and other activities.
One aspect that irritated us a bit are the LEDs on the top side of the router. In small rooms, they can get quite annoying during the night. Luckily, you can fiddle with the settings of this router and set the WPS button to act as a button for turning them On and Off, which is great.
In the week that we tested this router, we were generally pleased with its performance. However we did notice a few issues:
Applying changes to wireless settings can take a long time and require a restart of your router.
During one night, the two wireless networks stopped broadcasting, even if we did not set any schedule for their operation. We had to restart the router and then everything was back to normal.
We noticed performance drops for brief periods of time. During most of our testing, ASUS RT-AC58U performed well, as you will see in our sections with benchmarks. However, for brief periods of time, the speed of the wireless network would drop without any explanation and then get back to normal a couple of minutes later. This issue was encountered mostly on the 2.4 GHz wireless frequency and less on the 5GHz frequency.
These issues seem to be firmware related. The hardware on the ASUS RT-AC58U is quite able to deliver fast and stable wireless network connections and future firmware updates should fix these problems.
Setting up the ASUS RT-AC58U wireless router is quick and painless. The multi-lingual support is excellent, help documentation is easily available and advanced users will get a lot of control. However, there are a few downsides to consider: you cannot mount this router on walls and its firmware does have some stability issues that affect the wireless network (which should be fixed in future updates). Other than that, the hardware on this router is very capable of delivering very fast wireless networks, as you will see later in this review.
To learn more about the real-world performance offered by this router, as well as our final verdict, read the next page in this review.

What does AC1200, AC1750, AC1900 or more, mean and what's the difference?
Misc by Ciprian Adrian Rusen
published on 06/25/2019
All wireless routers have AC in their name, followed by a number. For example, you have routers that are called: Tenda AC9 AC1200, TP-Link Archer C7 AC1750, NETGEAR Nighthawk XR500 AC2500, or ASUS RT-AC88U AC3100. What does this AC followed by a number mean? Does the number following AC tell you how fast the router is? Is an AC1900 router faster than an AC1200 router? In theory, manufacturers say that it is. In reality, the truth is different.

ASUS FX HDD review:
The portable hard drive with RGB and AURA Sync!
Review by Codrut Neagu
published on 06/27/2019
ASUS has a tradition of designing devices with great RGB lighting systems. We have seen motherboards, CPU coolers, PC cases, keyboards, mice, and whatnot with RGB. However, we have never seen an external hard drive with RGB on it. Until this review! :) The device is called ASUS FX HDD, and it is a hard drive destined for backups, which has AURA-compatible RGB LEDs on it. Featuring lighting inspired by the Mayan culture, the ASUS FX HDD has a unique look. If you want to know more about it, read this review:

How we test
Overall score includes:
WiFi performance (60%) – measured at 4m and 10m from the router. We calculated the speeds, in megabits per second (Mbps), using online speed testing apps. We repeated the test 3 times on each band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) and at each distance. The speeds from both distances were averaged and scored compared to the speeds expected for the WiFi standards they were using.
Ease of use and setup (20%) – based on an assessment of set up and how easy the device is to use including monitoring and managing network access and changing default settings (service set identifier (SSID), network key/password, encryption and WiFi protected set-up (WPS) settings). We also looked at the ease of accessing advanced functions such as guest networks, virtual private network (VPN), attached external media and parental control tools.
Security (20%) – looked at whether the networks were encrypted, how easy it was to identify them by SSID, and the security of the network key/password.
If a USB storage device can be connected to the router so that media is shared on the network. Also called Media Server and ReadyShare.
DLNA is a certification that guides how media can be shared amongst devices over a network. It is often used with media sharing.
Where a 3g or 4G USB dongle is connected through a USB port. The router can then route the 3G/4G signal through the WiFi network.
Price is based on a December 2018 online price survey.

These installation instructions are based on the original ones at https://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt/openwrt.git;a=commit;h=87c42101cfb001b4bd418d1201fa4d8c822dc77b, written by the author of the OpenWrt port for the Asus RT-AC58U.
Open the case of the router, as described in the Opening the case section.
Connect a serial cable, as described in the Serial section. This requires soldering a pin header on the router PCB.
Connect an Ethernet cable to one of the four LAN-ports (yellow).
Open a serial terminal program and connect to the port used for the serial connection to the router.
Power on the router. The serial terminal will show the bootloader messages and after a few seconds will come to a menu with several options. Select here option #1 for loading a new firmware into RAM. The selection has to be done within 3 seconds, otherwise the router will continue its normal startup; in case of missing this short timeout, just restart the router.
At this point, the router will try to connect to a tftp server on the computer for downloading the initial firmware image. First it asks for a few parameters for configuring the connection: the router's IP address (192.168.1.1, default value), the computer's IP address (default is 192.168.1.70, should be changed to the actual address) and the filename of the firmware image (the .itb file in the table above).
Then the transfer starts, also indicated by the blinking of one of the LEDs. Wait until the LED stops blinking. At this point OpenWrt is running, but it is only stored in the router's RAM, so it will disappear after a reboot. The next steps will do a proper flashing.
Copy over the final firmware image via scp (the default IP address of the router is 192.168.1.1 and there is no password for root): scp openwrt-...-sysupgrade.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp
where the .bin file is the one in the table above.
Connect to the router via ssh as root: ssh root@192.168.1.1
and simply hit Enter when asked for the password.
Delete the “jffs2” ubi partition to make room for the new root partition:
ubirmvol /dev/ubi0 --name=jffs2
Finally, install OpenWrt to flash:
sysupgrade -v /tmp/openwrt-...-sysupgrade.bin
using the same .bin filename as above. This will automatically reboot the router - into OpenWrt!
Easy Installation
*WARNING - backup calibration data first: https://forum.openwrt.org/t/ac58u-no-wireless-option-in-network-after-installing-18-06-1/19378*
Go to Zyxmon's AC58U builds page and download the XXX-squashfs-flash-factory.trx file.
On the router, go to Administration → Firmware Upgrade (or probably http://192.168.1.1/Advanced_FirmwareUpgrade_Content.asp).
Upload the file and wait until the router has rebooted into OpenWrt.
Delete jffs2 partition by using SSH on 192.168.1.1, login as root/no password and enter umount /mnt/ubi0_5 (in case the partition is mounted) and then ubirmvol /dev/ubi0 -N jffs
Go back to browser 192.168.1.1 click login (without a password) and proceed to http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/flashops.
Get the latest OpenWrt from the top on this page (XXX-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin) and flash it. Make sure to uncheck 'Keep settings.'
You now have a fully working AC58U router on OpenWrt.
Detailed info is available here: http://lede-ac58u.zyxmon.org/HowToFlashENG.html
Returning to stock
Warning: this will only work on Windows-based computers.
To go back to factory firmware you need to remove ubi volumes that are different in OpenWrt and stock. After the router reboots, U-Boot bootloader will automatically restore the stock partitions and enter recovery mode. To delete ubi volumes we will use sysupgrade script with -F (force) flag and junk firmware. In this case sysupgrade will remove three volumes linux, rootfs and rootfs_data. Since we use a junk file as a firmware, sysupgrade will not be able to calculate new volumes sizes and will reboot router. To avoid bootloop we will remove linux2 volume wich is a copy of linux volume.
Download and install the latest ASUS Firmware Restoration Tool from here (click Show All at utilities) and download the latest router firmware from here.
Connect the router to your computer with a cable. If you don't get an IP address via DHCP, try performing a reset on the router and setting a manual IP address with:IP address:
192.168.1.10
subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
router:
192.168.1.1
Connect to the router via ssh as root:ssh root@192.168.1.1
and enter your password when asked for it.
Write ubirmvol /dev/ubi0 -N linux2
and press enter to delete the volume.
After this, write sysupgrade -F /bin/busybox
and press enter. The router will now be in recovery/rescue mode.
Run the restoration tool.
Select the firmware we downloaded and click Upload. The file should start uploading immediately. If it doesn't upload, reboot the router and try again. Be patient, the restoration might take some time.
The router should reboot and you should be back on the ASUS firmware.
Flash Layout
Find out flash layout, then add the flash layout table here (copy, paste, modify the example).
Please check out the article Flash layout. It contains examples and explanations that describe how to document the flash layout.
Upgrading OpenWrt
The generic upgrade instructions work well with the Asus RT-AC58U, see generic.sysupgrade to understand what are the available options, how to back-up and how to restore the current configuration and the installed packages.
Briefly, the following methods can be used.
LuCI Web Upgrade Process
Browse to System ⇒ Backup / Flash Firmware
Upload the sysupgrade image file
Wait for reboot
Terminal Upgrade Process
Alternatively, if a GUI (LuCI) is not available, the upgrade can be done via the command line.
There are two command line methods for upgrading:
sysupgrade
mtd
Note: It is important to save the firmware image file on the ramdisk (/tmp) before flashing. In the commands below, replace the dummy links with the correct download link from the table under Installation.
sysupgrade
Login as root via SSH on 192.168.1.1, then enter the following commands:
cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/.../targets/ipq40xx/generic/openwrt-...-sysupgrade.bin
sysupgrade -v /tmp/openwrt-...-sysupgrade.bin
mtd
Under special circumstances or if the above methods do not work, another possibility is to use the mtd command.
Login as root via SSH on 192.168.1.1, then enter the following commands:
cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/.../targets/ipq40xx/generic/openwrt-...-sysupgrade.bin
mtd write /tmp/openwrt-...-sysupgrade.bin linux && reboot

Info
This table is automatically generated, once the correct filters for Brand and Model are set.
If you see “Nothing.” instead of a table, please edit this section and adjust the filters with the proper Brand and Model. Just try, it's easy.
If you still don't see a table here, or a table filled with '¿': Is there already a Techdata page available for Asus RT-AC58U ? If not: Create one.
If you see a table with the desired device data, everything is OK and you can delete this text and the <WRAP> that encloses it.
If it still doesn't work: Don't panic, calm down, take a deep breath and contact a wiki admin (tmomas) for help.

Opening the case
Note: This will void your warranty!
Remove the 4 rubber feet; there is a screw under each of them
Remove the 4 screws; this partially releases the top cover of the router
The top cover is still held in place by 2 plastic clips, at the middle of each of the long edges; it is a little flexible and can be fully released by lifting one of the short edges and slightly bending the whole cover by pushing the long edges towards each other
Main PCB:
Serial
→ port.serial general information about the serial port, serial port cable, etc.
How to connect to the Serial Port of this specific device:
The serial port operates at a voltage level of 3.3 V, so only use something like an USB-to-serial adapter that can provide 3.3 V. Using a standard serial cable or an USB-to-serial adapter that provides 5 V will likely damage the serial port on the router.
Only the GND, Rx and Tx pins need to be connected.
