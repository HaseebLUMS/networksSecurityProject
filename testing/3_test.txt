This camera has 2-axis lens adjustment, there is no 3rd-axis adjustment to bring the horizon view back to level. This is fine for mounting the camera with the dome bubble downwards e.g. under a soffit or attached to a ceiling, or with its back to the wall and looking directly ahead (at any angle up/down). However, if you need to tilt the lens assembly to one side to achieve the desired view, you will need a wall-mount bracket and to mount the dome camera pendant-style in order to look to one side and have a level horizon.Hikvision User Manual V5.0"|http://www.use-ip.co.uk/hikvision-ds-2cd2132-i-6mm-3mp-ir-fixed-dome-camera.html|http://www.use-ip.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/n/untitled_27_11_3.jpg|181.2|GBP
