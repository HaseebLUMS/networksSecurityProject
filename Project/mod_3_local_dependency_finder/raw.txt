Who's Online52 visitors online now3 guests, 49 bots, 0 membersMap of VisitorsBookmarksAmazon Web ServicesCloudSiksha BlogMicrosoft AzureVirtualBoxWindows 10 UpgradeHOW to HACK into Broadband ADSL Modem (Router) and get the BroadBand User ID and Password!! November 5, 2010 by Saugata55NOTE: Purpose of this article is to help people to protect their own ADSL Router, and how to made them more secure, to avoid such indecent in future. First connect to your broadband, and goto http://whatismyip.com to know your public IP Address.
Now you need Port Scanner software, here I used a free one from RadMIN. Open Port Scanner after install and type your IP Range like following figure and set port range from 80 to 81.Hit Scan button as soon as you finish above steps.
After finish scanning you have to look for the alive IP Addresses those have port 80 opened like following figure.Here I have found IP Address with port 80 opened. No you have to open that IP Address from internet Explorer like following figure.If everything went fine, It will ask you for user id and password, and out of 10 ADSL Router, at least 6 having default password, coz no one bother to change that default password L .So, give it a try with following ID and Pass:ID : admin / Pass : admin (most common) ID : admin / Pass : admin123 ID : admin / Pass : admin321 ID : root / Pass : root ID : root / Pass : admin ID : admin / Pass : root ETC…Wow!! I have got the access… Now I can do whatever I want. But I don’t want to do anything. 🙂
You can access any settings on the ADSL Router.Now you need an Asterisk Key recovery tool to get the broadband user ID and PasswordHere password recovered successfully in a second. 🙂
NOW, the question is how you are going to protect your own ADSL Router? Simple!! You have to check few things, add some extra security to avoid such incident in future. CHECKLIST! After Installation of your modem, ask the engineer about your modem user id and password. 90% of ADSL Modem using http://192.168.1.1 for their own console, so logon to that console and change your modem console password immediately. If you are using your modem to connect internet for only one system, it’s recommended to configure modem as BRIDGE type, coz, here you have to dial from your own desktop, so, it’s not required to save your broadband user id and password in your modem. In some router, you can restrict console access, if it is supported by your router, and then enable it for Private Network only. Finally, if you are reading this topic, then after reading, tell your friends about this hole, and secure yourself as well as your friends. 🙂Disclaimer: All posts and opinions on this site are provided AS IS with no warranties.

August 1, 2012 at 7:01 am	 The hardest part of this task is how do you manage to know what password on their modem. Ok, many people don’t bother or knowing how to change the password. If that was the case then easy, but if not than a brute force attack will do Reply

Akshat says:
April 30, 2013 at 12:56 pm	 hello, thanks for tips above. I want some help from you. Actually I have a BSNL ADSL+wifi router manufactured by teracom (Type W2 V1.00) model no. TDSL300W2 which I was using when I had a broadband connection from BSNL. But now I am having having a broadband connection hosted by a private company in Kanpur,UP. I was trying to connect it to the broadband modem of BSNL but it never connected and says DHCP not enabled on diagnosis. Can you let me way that I can use that modem as a router for my new internet connection. I think the problem is that the ip in the modem is set default to one that of BSNL (192.168.1.1) but the ip of my service provider is different and the DSL light keep on blinking.Help me please!!!Thanks. Reply
Saugata says:
July 2, 2013 at 4:20 am	 It will work on other provider as well, you have to configure it manually. If you are able to ping & access 192.168.1.1 and you are able to logon to the web gui, then you can configure it for different provider. You have to get the VPI & VCI value for other provider, also you have to make sure other provider support ADSL modem or not. Reply

Saugata says:
October 8, 2015 at 9:38 pm	 Yes, it is possible, but BSNL allow accessing broadband. Sometimes they restrict access against your modem MAC address, in that case you have to use same MAC address in your modem, and in most of the modem there was a option to change MAC address manually under settings.I will always recommended not to do so. Reply

October 1, 2015 at 4:10 pm	 great article man………really nice work. i have got access to many adsl modems thanks to you. but i got 2 question.. 1 why u select port 80-81 only? 2 now i have access many modems but how can i use or divert
their bandwidth on my computer Reply
Saugata says:
October 8, 2015 at 9:36 pm	 1 – Port 80/81 is the default port for web access. 2 – You you can, but depending on how ISP allow accessing broadband. Sometimes they restrict access against your modem MAC address, in that case you have to use same MAC address in your modem, and in most of the modem there was a option to change MAC address manually under settings. I will always recommended not to do so. Reply

October 9, 2015 at 6:03 pm	 Hello ,SaugataI am actually using TP link modem+router i checked all settings over there but there is no option for changing MAC address so is there any other frimware for changing to MAC address or to clone MAC address how one of my friend have access to internet using my credential please explain to me and one thing more do we route our internet through our wifi modem through RJ 11 is it possible or notThanks in advance Uttam Mallah whatsapp +919023129291 Reply
Saugata says:
March 1, 2016 at 1:53 am	 Sorry for late response, could you please let me know which model you are using?DD-WRT or openwrt provide advance firmware for many modems / router. I am using TP Link router with DD-WRT firmware for last two years without having any issue. There are many additional option including MAC cloning, where you can virtually change your router MAC address and able to connect using your friends credentials.I don’t understand your last question, is it like you what to share your Internet connection via wifi?Regards, Saugata D Reply
fritz says:
October 29, 2015 at 6:24 am	 this is total crap. the reason why it works is, you are actually within the network and despite trying to get to the website from outside, the access is routed inside the network. just take your smartphone, disable your wifi and try it with your smartphone connection (external connetion => now your really access from outside the network) … et voila … no access. Reply
Saugata says:
November 3, 2015 at 6:51 am	 I think you misunderstood, this is from external network, used port scanner to scan public IP range to find out opened ports. Reply
Saugata says:
March 1, 2016 at 1:41 am	 It will work if your ISP gave you public IP when you are connecting to Internet. In India BSNL assign public IP to every ADSL connection. Reply
surya says:
December 8, 2015 at 1:20 pm	 THE best way to protect is through MAC ID filtering . Entry the your required wifi enable lap/mobiles WIFI MAC ID to the modem. only these gadgets can access to the network Reply
Saugata says:
December 11, 2015 at 9:16 am	 Yes, it is true, but not recommended for everyone, in case of any wrong entry, someone will end up with resetting the router. ReplyPingback: How To Get Into A Network Without Password | How To Get

Saugata says:
June 12, 2016 at 4:12 pm	 Do a factory reset.Steps: The Router may be reset to the original factory default settings by using a ballpoint or paperclip to gently push down the reset button in the following sequence: 1. Press and hold the reset button while the device is powered off. 2. Turn on the power. 3. Wait for 10 seconds and then release the reset button.Remember that this will wipe out any settings stored in flash memory including user account information and LAN IP settings.

Hack # 1 : How to Login into RouterLogin over telnet. This is a common feature of all router these days and this the only way to hack into box: Default IP: 192.168.1.1 Default Username: admin Default Password: passwordI have changed IP of router to 192.168.1.254 so here is my first session:$ telnet 192.168.1.254Trying 192.168.1.254… Connected to 192.168.1.254. Escape character is ‘^]’. BCM96338 ADSL Router Login: admin password: ******** Once you are logged in you will see menu: Main Menu1. ADSL Link State 2. LAN 3. WAN 4.
DNS Server 5. Route Setup 6. NAT 7. Firewall 8. Quality Of Service 9. Management 10. Passwords 11. Reset to Default 12. Save and Reboot 13. Exit ->Hack # 2: Get out of this stupid shell menu script/program Yup, it is stupid stuff and don’t waste your time hitting CTRL+C, CTRL+D keys, to get out of this script/program (break shell script), just type sh and hit enter key at arrow prompt -> -> shAnd you will be taken to shell BusyBox v1.00 (2005.09.20-19:57+0000) Built-in shell (msh) Enter ‘help’ for a list of built-in commands. #Hack # 3: But where is my ls command… Type ls or dir command,# lsls: not found# dirdir: not foundThey have removed the ls and dir command. But don’t worry you can use old echo command trick:# echo *bin dev etc lib linuxrc mnt proc sbin usr var websecho * is old trick which displays list of all files in current directory without using ls or dir command.Hack #4: Looking for advanced web based configuration, use main.html Yet another stupid thing, they have removed main.html from web based configuration. Basically main.html is use to configure advanced options of router like port forwarding, DNS setting, firewall etc.Just type http://192.168.1.254/main.html (replace 192.168.1.254 with your actual router IP address) to get all advanced options.Hack # 5: Get more information about router hardware and Linux Since this is tiny device most of the userland command such as free, uname etc are removed. However /proc file system provides all information:Display CPU Information# cat /proc/cpuinfoDisplay RAM Information# cat /proc/meminfoDisplay Linux versions# cat /proc/versionLinux version 2.6.8.1 (root@localhost.localdomain) (gcc version 3.4.2) #1 Tue Sep 20 15:52:07 EDT 2005Display list of running Processes:# ps Display list of all kernel module (drivers):# cat /proc/modulesHack # 6: Get more information about your network configuration Display list of network interfaces# ifconfigGet default routing information i.e. find out your ISP’s router:# routeDisplay Iptables rules# iptables -L -nHack 6 : Secure your router (A) Fire web browser such as firefox and login to web based interface. Type url http://192.168.1.1/ main.html (or 192.168.1.254/main.html)(B) Enable Firewall Click on Security > Ip filtering > Outgoing or Incoming > Click add(C) Change default admin password Click on Tools > Select Administrator and type the password. > Click apply(D) Save changes and reboot router Click on Management > Access Control > Password > Select Admin > Setup new passwordSave changes and reboot router.Quick reboot router with reboot command:# rebootSee also:Hacking the Dlink 502T routerShell Script to reboot DSL/ADSL routerShare on

does it increase the net speed? is there any way we can increase the net speed by coufiguring the router? nixcraft says:
April 22, 2006 at 9:56 am
Noop,However, you can increase user experience by configuring local proxy server (such as Squid) and local dns server.Airtelâ€™s DNS servers are overloaded sometime it take upto 2-3 seconds before you get result.Hope this helps Anonymous says:

I have UTstarcom 300R2U modem which uses the same Broadcom chipset. All the telnet menus are exactly the same. Can u tell me how to log on to the modem remotely ie from the internet. I cant do it even after entering the correct admin password. nixcraft says:
May 15, 2006 at 11:17 am
You need to enable WAN access to telnet service. Here are the steps:Login to router from local network: telnet router-ipa) You will get Main menu b) Type 9 to select Management c) Type 4 to Select Access Control d) Type 1 to Select Services e) Again Type 1 to configure f) Type 6 to select telnet g) Type 1 to Enable It should like as follows:LAN [1-enable,2-disable] (2) : 1 WAN [1-enable,2-disable] (2) : 1Exit and come back to main menu select 12 to save and reboot router. Now you can connect router from internet using Public IP assigned by your ISP. Anonymous says:

Thanks for ur reply but i have tried accessing the Html interface of the modem by enabling http service from WAN. When i type in my external modem ip from net i get a prompt asking for username and password of “dsl Router” but even after entering the correct admin password (which works from LAN) i cant access the GUI.I tried telnetting into it also by enabling telnet access from WAN services but that also doesnt work. I get an error “Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”I have searched a lot but even in main menu ie 192.168.1.1/main.html , i cant find any option to enable disable or change webserver port for remote access.There are three accounts in this broadcom router ie admin, support and user, maybe the support account needs to be used to gain access from external networkI would also like to add that my ISP doesnt block any ports, so the problem is with the router only. :::::H@CkING_GoD::::: says:

NO NEED TO TELNET GUYZ!!! u can easily do this thruogh IE(Internet Explorer)…just open the IP thru browser on port 80 which is the default port(http)…to make it clear..i’ll giv u guyz an example.. the situation is that u wanna get into my router so what u will hav to do is just get my ip and then open it thru browser like http://59.176.27.70…(My ip is 59.176.27.70 in this case)…..to make it EVEN MORE CLEAR…to hack sum1z router goto http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (replace xxx with the victim’s ip)….and then type in the default username and password….most common user name and password is ‘admin’ eg. username:admin password:admin…THATS IT!!!DO U GUYZ KNOW U CAN EVEN GET THE USER NAME AND PASSWORD OF THE PPPoE/PPPoA connection…after getting into his router and find the password…most of the routers hide this password behind ‘*’..now to see whats behind it there are many tools called ‘unmask password’….There u go…And yes guyz u can increase ur net speed(u cant increase from router but u can increase it by 20% by configuring ur PC!!)..Its not that difficult..i will post it later if i see the need…CheersH@cKInG_GoD :::::the_chatting_god@msn.com::::: Anonymous says:

@buzz_cooldude, Short answer:, Noop, Long answer: Speed for ADSL/DSL is controlled by your ISP (in your case Airtel). To get higher speed you need to contact them. :::::H@CkING_GoD::::: says:

Can I make it redirect all WAN:http (port 80) requests to 192.168.1.2:80 (that’s my homepage on Linux/apache2)?If yes, how? nixcraft says:
July 18, 2006 at 7:04 pm
No you cannot. As port 80 used by Beetel router. Howver you can setup your Apache to listen on port 81 and redirect all traffic comming to WAN:http (port 81) requests to 192.168.1.2:81. With beetel you need to use port other than 80.If you are using Dlink router, it allows to change default router http management port 80 to 81 and then you can redirect WAN:80 to PC:80. But this is not avilable with Beetel. Anonymous says:

Hey- I am trying to setup a webserver on my comp, with the BEETEL 220x,I am currently using the WAMP using the below steps. But whenever I am trying to acces it from outside, it is taking to the DSL Router home page. Please help. Click Start –> Run –> type “cmd” (without quotes) –> Hit Enter/Return.In the Command Prompt that opens up, type “ipconfig” (without quotes).Note down your internal/LAN IP address.2. Goto the Beetel Router config page, http://192.168.1.1/main.html3. Click Advanced Setup –> NAT –> Virtual Servers –> Click “Add”4. Under Server Name check “Select a Service” and from the Drop Down Menu select “Web Server (HTTP)”.In “Server IP Address” box enter the IP address you noted in Step 1.Click on Save/Apply. You will get a message “Since port 80 is used, the DSL router WEB server port will be moved to 8080”, click “OK”.This basically forwards all your HTTP traffic on port 80 of your WAN IP, received by your router, to your Internal/LAN IP and moves the Admin Page of the Router to port 8080.5. Verify your setup by going to Anonymouse and entering this URL http://125.22.35.159(WAN IP) If it opens your WAMP Index Page, Congratulations you’re done with configuring your Router.But it is still not working..

> i m using internet cable connection 80kbps. > but i want increase speed uo to 128 kbps > with out pay any cost Everyone wanna free cheese but don’t forget, if you see free cheese, this is definitely mousetrap.As for speed, usually, ADSL provider either limits ADSL physical speed from it’s side or uses traffic shaping on its side.This done from operator’s side and there is nothing you can do about it from your side.Your modem does not performs rate limiting at all.Of course in theory you can manage to get access to DSLAM or billing system and tweak your DSLAM port or traffic shaping setup, but you’re strongly advised not even to try to do so since operator surely knows who is phone’s line owner and will kick your ass quickly if you’ll manage to cause any malfunction to operator’s side hardware (this will cause dozen of unhappy customers and operator will really take some steps to kick your ass).

Put the beetel at the ISP termination , ie, the RJ11. Connect the netgear in dynamic ip address – the beetel will assign ip , dns etc etc by putting an ethernet patch cord ( RJ45 ) between the the two devices. Thats it.

Hi Geeks I tried to host a web server inside my lan and fixed it as a virtual server on NAT setup on my router configuration, I mapped the ports properly it didn’t work. Then i created an incoming firewall allow incoming connection exception on router for port 5001 (i use that port as a test and my IIS is running on 5001 as well). That didn’t work even. I created a windows firewall rule as well, but the requests are not reaching at all to my windows firewall. Any idea how can I verify where it is getting blocked ? vinay says:

I have queries Queries: Q1. I have Dynamic IP with No-ip DNS services and running WebServer at home on Port 80 Port Forwarding and Firewall allows redirects to port 80 as configured on my Webserver. Is it possible to use No-ip domain names to allow redirect to other folder on my computer? or have a another host assigned in the Server config, pointing to other server. What NAT settings for running another HOST/ HTTP server on the SAME IP but different port/pointing to different folder is required.Q2 I can telnet other computers on my ISP, is it possible somehow to hack through the modem 220bx using above steps and be able to access the contents of the Victims computer, leaving aside the settings of the ROUTER/MODEM as accessed here using the buil-In Unix/linux in it? This hack is for Router/Modem Software only not for the computer..is it so? how…can I do what I asked.Waitin, Kunal Delhi Apurva Mirajkar says:
July 1, 2007 at 2:29 am
Hey, this is great info. But has anyone seen an issue where the 220bx is not able authentic, when the dynamic DNS service is able. On the local subnet i have no issue, but if i assess the modem out for the web, it is not able to authentic. I have done a reset, but no go. Anyone has any idea on this one. I did not have this issue sometime back, but out of no where this has started. Karan says:
July 3, 2007 at 10:27 am
Hi Apurva Mirajkar !Are you talking about DynDNS client you installed or the build in DynDNS feature in 220bx for Dynamic IP.I havent tried it yet (220Bx DynDns Feature n other too)..but heard it works. Please add Virtual servers and port forwarding is done okayed..also ensure that windows Firewall allows you to run HTTP webserver at port 80, if you are doing so. Some settings inside Router 220bx may be changed. You can alternatively try to reset the Modem cum Router and RETRY – with original settings!Also check config at DynDNS.org if you have done some changes reset to defaults.Hope it Works…I’ll come back to check.PS :

Thanx for your reply, Karan!Yup, I am talking about DynDNS. I have reset both dynDNS setting and the Modem. No luck.I know my settings are fine as, i can get to the authentication required window but my 220BX modem will not authenticate. If i did it from any of my computers inside my subnet (192.168.1.x and 192.168.0.x) no issues but from WWW, Nope it just does not.Something is tell me, i could be a victim of brute force attack and the Swap memory is flooded, very hypothetical reason. Until some one has a better reasoning to this, as it has worked before and this thing has started since few days.Any ideas? The next thing i would be trying is creating a bridge b/w the 220bx and my netgear wireless router. That way i would take 220bx out of the equation. DIneshkumar.G says:

Hi Friends,For APURVA :Not got any further ideas, as I have’nt come yet to use this DynDns feature in 220BX.Reason for non-functionality may be either: 1. Modem Settings have changed 2. May be Airtel banned usage 3. Port may be firewalled from Modem or Computer, or has not been port-forwarded well. 4. DynDNS service providers may not be supporting it any longer.I would recommend you to instead try out the DYNDns client and use it on a remote computer.You just need to know the IP of your computer from remote machine, that you can ensure by just having the DNS name/IP (static/dyn for time being) you got and pinging it from remote computer or may be try pinging from a mobile.Just keep your Servers RUnning …..!FOR the HacKeneTics :I AM LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO BAN A PARTICULAR IP to access my computer or disallow his pings/telnets/http etc. services/requests to be used from my IP. Any one got any IDEAS….does this can be done on 220bx to Ban an IP from pinging or establishing a TCP/UDP/NetBios or other connections.. May be it is there in Modem 220bx or Airtel subnet I am part of does not allow me to do this…..Any ONE for this …..reply back soon.LUV:KARANPS: zxdsl 831 may be same kinda menu options Vikas…..is it the ZYXEL one…yeah! .. it is somewhat similar…Ask the Author here !

Hey Karan!It is my 220bx causing the issue. Now with my Netgear router facing the web, i am able to access without any issues. There was one other person, report the same problem with 220BX, check Anonymous Says: August 22nd, 2006 at 7:43 am.Looks to be known issue with 220BX.

It may be your own IP address; you should always use firewall to protect yourself. It may be also possible that you are using bittorent and you will see IPs near by computers while sharing files. manpreet singh says:

August 2, 2007 at 7:33 am
Hi Ashish!Firstly you have to enable FTP or Telnet Service and ports (also portforward these services) in the 220bx modem cum router.This also has to be configured internally in the Windows Firewall or Firewall you have installed to allow the services on FTP / Telnet Port to run..21/23 portsNow the basic thing you need to do is you have to run either a Telnet or FTP server to have access to the files from other computer. Why don’t you try BPFTP (bullet proof ftp server) there are others free too.For FTP :On Remote computer you wish to access : You should have FTP server running and not blocking you with proper modem / firewall/ port forward settings. And allowing the access for other computer.On Computer (Client) : You could have a FTP client and enter ftp:// you could try out ftp:// in Internet Explorer as well.That’s it Problem solved. Is’nt it? Now do some research or read something, if you dont get all this.You are welcome!I am regular visitor here and look for new hacks. may be vivek would provide.Bye KARAN KARAN says:

Try Disabling Zone Alarm Completely instead.What are the settings on the other computer…i.e. the Friends computer you are trying to connect…does it have FTP server or TELNET running on the Modem.FOR FTP: You should Run FTP server on Friends computer with security settings adjusted to allow all access or access to your IP.On your computer being client you should have FTP client software or iexplore ftp://&gt; SECURITY may be.I some time ago…FTPied..Successfully to myself from OUTSIDE and RUN HTTP server on my computer as well.You could TELNET the others or friends MODEm, but I don’t know how you go about accessing others computer when its behind a TELNET on MODEM as well as TELNET server on COMPUTEr.

Hi Sorocco!admin – password user – pass user – password user-beetel admin-beetel administrator – passwordTry all kind of combinations, I was able to change it sometime back and now myself dont remember, what it is set to now…But probably wont tryAlthough Support password wont be easy…As I was unable to open it.Find a List here for Modem/Routers:LIST OF DEFAULT PASSWORDSProbably POST method post wont go beyond 255 char so it is not stored as GET, is there actually a way to detect a POST post to a webserver Vivek?, in the Web Server or Log somewhere…probably would be good hack…as it would help find out unsuccessful comments/posts here.– KaranI posted this too…. Tracking someone via their IP address is possible. If a person has committed a crime online, typically the authorities send a subpoena to the ISP that person subscribes to (determined by seeing what ISP the address is assigned to). The ISP then can check their logs (they are required by law to keep logs for a certain amount of time) to see what customer they gave that IP address to at the time of the alleged crime. This works by checking the logged username of the person (if logged in via dialup or PPPoE) or the MAC address (a unique address assigned to a piece of network hardware when it is manufactured) of the machine connected (if via DSL or other broadband connection). Either the username or MAC address are tied to a customer. soroccoheaven says:

beetel 220bx owner’s pls change your default passwprds for admin,user, support accounts. because:1.Access to your DSL router is controlled through three user accounts: admin, support, and user.2.The user name “admin” has unrestricted access to change and view configuration of your DSL Router.3.The user name “support” is used to allow an ISP technician to access your DSL Router for maintenance and to run diagnostics.4.The user name “user” can access the DSL Router, view configuration settings and statistics, as well as, update the router’s software.

Hi People!@rdb / Rohit
@Rohit it is similar as in for XP/ try 192.168.1.1/main.htmlMore… It’s not actually possible to increase the speed as per done by Airtel at backend…however you can finetune your connection/port-forward for particular Internet application. I did’nt do anythin on my Airtel BB, its working as same. May be if you have less of RAM (..increase it. )/more programs running in background(esp. internet prog/AV/FW etc.), it would hamper your surfing speeds.@Ricardo Verdi First portforward using your Modem Guide or search for router/modem manual or settings webpage on Internet. If Windows or Installed Firewall is enabled do check for not blocking your 8004 port. Use some app like ActivePorts (aports.exe) to check for ports being used on your computer. Also, chk with ISP if it is blocking that port…there are many ways to do it.If your Router/Modem allows telnet, chk it to port-forward, through that mode.@Steel What is nikto?Yes, you can change the default DNS settings as per Airtel, to some other DNS server settings or your Own. But it would also have to go thru Airtel/your ISPs server that’s why the ping remains high. If you connecting using LAN or your own N/w it would decrease considerably..bypassing the Internet 😉@Uday Its simple man ! Enable HTTP port 80 in Win ICF or XP2 firewall n also installed firewall. Port forward port 80 in modem page as per this guide.Follow this guide, as I found:*HOW TO: Set up a Webserver at HOME*Very ValuableBye,

There are people who want to host a website on port 80 on their computer and their are mostly negative responses to that (..sigh). What you’ll need to do is called port-forwarding on your router. This is how: 1. log in the router via the telnet interface and go through the menu Management>Access Control>Services>Configure>http>disable on wan; now enter ‘sh’ to get the command shell. 2. enter these commands to expose one of you _computers_ ports outside. (port forwarding) # iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i ppp_1_32_1 –destination –destination-port 80 -j DNAT –to-destination :80 # iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp -m state –state NEW -d –destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT* the parameter ppp_1_32_1 is the service name you entered in the web interface while configuring your internet address. Alternatively you can figure this name out by entering “ifconfig” in the command shell and look for the interface that holds your external-ip-address. * can be determined from sites like whatismyip.com if by entering ifconfig ppp_1_32_1 (note above) in the command shell. * is the one assigned to your computer. look for “client-ip-address” in your computers settings. nixclusive says:

I was looking at the http server on this, and whoever programmed the javascript is a dum***. the reason being is that you can look at the source code for the password change page, and all the passwords are there (except the ftp password). it goes:pwdAdmin = ‘password’; pwdSupport = ‘supportuser’; pwdUser = ‘normaluser’;which are the default passwords for the accounts. Also, whoever was using Airtel to send Vi*****a ads, your a pain in the ass, and I’m onto you. nixCraft says:

Hello, im a german student living in india for about 1 year. So my appartement here is ( or should ) be connected via a Beetel 220BX ADSL router to Airtel DSL. But i have the big problem, that the router always hangs up after just one minute or something like that. No reaction on Telnet or the Webinterface anymore. I called Airtel several times because of that, but they couldnt help me more than to tell me that i have to reboot the router. Thats weird. For the first 5 Minutes my download speed is about 2mbit as it should be, but after the webserver and telnetserver hangs up the download speed decreases to 20kb/sec max. The airtel people also told me that theres already the newest firmware installed on it. Does anyone here have an idea what i can do?Please contact me @ jhornung1984@web.de or just reply here. webmaster says:

HI FOXY, its a common problem of hanging in 220 bx, if it is connected through a USB Cable. i suggest you to use it with an ethernet cable. for latest firmware visit http://beetelmodems.com/220bx.html.and for the speed problems it may be a problem in the medium(cable coming from airtel’s end), ask them to get it checked.

@ PCChazterThanks for the password, yah they are there in the main.html page’s Password (inner Frame).So, here comes another shocker for all those using Airtel Beetel 220BX Password.BEETEL 220BX Modem is flawed. I am not revealing this secret of now…..But a lot of damaged can be done to the people using the BEETEL modem, without actually knowing the Password. A lot is hidden in its firmware, which can reveal its dreadful side.Ask me for the More…and me n even you cannot safeguard against it. I am wondering whom should I tell it about.So, for the time being (assume u are secure) – KARAN@Foxi – I too use it @ USB but No Modem/Router hanging problems as such earlier or ever to me (500 Mhz, 64 mB XP). But nowaadays, I am seeing a strange behavior.Q: Does anyone know how to immediately release or disconnect a TCP/IP connection, I am seing in TIME_WAIT or SYN_SENT state in Port status (active ports), its hanged in there.? My Download app is suffering….Help Needed?? soroccoheaven says:

@karan …yeah thats what i was asking for @ PCChazter soroccoheaven says:
January 25, 2008 at 9:25 am
@ karan i am using beetel 220bx and changed all the password’s closed all other ports (from wan )and forwarded http,22 ports to a server (for remote access etc.).am i secure ? Karan says:
January 29, 2008 at 2:38 pm
@soroccoheavenNo! you and others are still not. I found a flaw in it…its firmware may be…which actually opens it for the world, i.e. anyone whose Modem is BEETEL 220BX in whole wide world, just his IP is required and presto you can make him disconnect outta INTERNET. No Passwords can actually protect…its password resistant or does’nt depend it on it at all.For a free Demo, I would recommend you to send me an IP or yours for a dummy test. Come back here and fix a time when you wish to have me a go on it…!!Its such a silly thing…inside its firmware anyone can find it out and do it remotely.Karan Raj says:
January 29, 2008 at 2:54 pm
Soroccoheaven,There is no thing called secure router or server. You can try your best to secure it. If you need 100% security unplug both electric and telephone lines 😉Karan, Almost all ISPs are insecure, especially cheap routers bundled with A/DSL / Cable connections. If beetel sucks get your good router such as Linksys or build your own 😉 Trust me I used to work for VSNL when dial-up connection used to cost 10000 ruppes and people used to steal your internet connection hour those days 😉Btw, vivek can we get rid of this *anti-spam word * for registered users? soroccoheaven says:
February 2, 2008 at 7:17 pm
@Raj ..yeah you are right when i say i am secure i mean the best i can be with this beetel i dont expect alot from it. @ Karan can you pls explain this ?.. nixCraft says:

Raj,Thanks for comment, if I remove anti-spam – I get tons of spam via bots. I don’t think so it will go anytime soon… heh Karan says:
February 9, 2008 at 9:57 pm
The Secret is …The internal Scripts inside your Modem cum Router Beetel 220BX can be remotely executed without actually providing the password / access….Enabling others to remotely Reboot/Reconfigure or Reset to Default Settings. Making your Internet Connection vulnerable…to attack(s).Without you knowin…at an instant. Atleast most of whom, having firmware like mine or may be in upgrades too.Rgds,KARAN Kris says:

Hi,I have a Beetel 220BX ADSL router provided by Airtel. I have connected it to a HUB, from HUB am connecting to a Laptop and a Desktop. What I want is to connect the Remote Desktop of the Desktop system from my Outside (office). I have installed SAP Server in my Desktop System. So, I want to access it from outside through SAP Logon (Client Application). That application (SAP Logon) needs SYSTEM CONNECTION PARAMETERS— Description: __________________ Application Server : System Name or IP Address System Number : ________ System ID: ______Application Server is the main to connect to the server, its the IP Address of the SAPSERVERAnyone can help me to NAT My Local IP to WAN IP. i.e. 192.168.1.2 to 122.xxx.xxx.xxx to access the server from any where from outside……Please help me………. soroccoheaven says:
February 16, 2008 at 4:28 pm
@kris ..you can direct wan traffic to particular local ip (use port forwarding 3389 for ms-term remote access,you have to configure your SAP server pc with static ip)but you can not connect because of dynamic IP.so get no-ip or dyndns account and configure beetel for DDNS.so now you connect/call you computer by using your domainname. kk says:

hi all,when i try to click on WAN link in the basic options page in my modem, it gives out “page not found” error.I’ve tried in advanced options with 192.168.1.1/main.html, but there are many links which report the same error. The WAN, NAT etc doesn’t work.Is this a modem problem. soroccoheaven says:

I have a problem just because sometimes I get a whopping 200 kBps speed for utorrent. I have a 128 kbps connection. “pls note kBps & kbps.” I tried to track all the reasons for this, from ‘time of the day’ to ‘my utorrent settings’ to ‘my connection settings’. I know dsl providers have these speed caps for all subscribers. but then how can I get this speed at any time. and if ever i can get this then why not for ever 🙁 ………???Do any one have any idea of the speed on demand facility that airtel provides. I wonder if any1 can breach thru n use this facility for free…get in touch if u have any idea…. Piyush says:

@ DSinghWhat OS are you using on both computers? If 9x and XP ensure that you start the 9x computer first and then XP computer to avoid glitches.Q’s Are you sharing the Internet connection b/w two computers? What kind of cable did you use to connect to Ethernet Card of other computer?…Straight or Cross…It should be straight if you are not sharing Internet(may be)Also, you have to manually setup the Internet Connection sharing i.e. the Network Setup for the same. Although, I used one with Internet and other for LAN(not internet) and computers talked to each others without any difficulty. I used :PC-I WinXP.. USB .. Beetel 220BX Beetel 220BX .. LAN ..STRAIGHT-CABLE ..EtherNet PC-II Win9X [Same may be with Both WinXP]What’s your case? Hoping this would help somehow. Karan says:
April 15, 2008 at 12:37 am
@ DSinghAlso ensure these:1.Both should be in Same LAN Workgroup 2.Both PC should be able to Ping each other 3.Ensure necessary Windows Services for Networking are started…Like Workstation, LAN related. 4.Try disabling the Firewall and then retry. 5.Try resetting the configuration again and restart from begining with fresh settings. i.e. The N/w Authentification settings b/w two computers should be known and configured properly.-KARAN janardhan says:

My friend told me you have to enable routing from telnet command and i did log in to router from telnet and did this as he said “route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1” without quote but nothing happened what am i missing here help me guys.I am desperate. kush says:

Hi Mangalman,if your PC and your sis’s PC are getting IP from the inbuilt DHCP server in your router/modem, I strongly suspect the culprit is the Windows Firewall assuming both the PCs are running Windows OS…u need to allow inbound connections in the Windows Firewall to connect to each other…NO NEED OF ROUTING CHANGES…as both the PCs are already in the same subnet…. prasad says:

So i want to know how to set by 192.168.1.1 – setup so that on needing internet i need to login with my username + pass. and change ip by just reconnecting.wud be glad if u also tell how to setup username + password later in the modem again as well.Can anyone tell me ? KARAN says:
September 17, 2008 at 11:13 am
@DineshJust switch on and Off the Router cum Modem Beetel 220BX.This would get you a new IP every time and change our Ip-identity. Your connection would resume automatically.However, to avoid glitches…disconnect from all Internet Sites and then Disable LAN connection and then switch off and restart would be better.-KARAN KARAN says:
September 17, 2008 at 11:18 am
@PRIYAPlease see my response to DSingh starting @DSingh.You need to Telnet LAN IP(among two computers) and allow connections.You could also run a small webserver[port 80] on One computer and access the Intranet b/w two computers.I believe this whole article, have enough for you to setup.-KARAN bahubali says:

Hey- I am trying to setup a webserver on my comp, with the BEETEL 220x,I am currently using the WAMP using the below steps. But whenever I am trying to acces it from outside, it is taking to the DSL Router home page. Please help. Click Start â€“> Run â€“> type â€œcmdâ€ (without quotes) â€“> Hit Enter/Return.In the Command Prompt that opens up, type â€œipconfigâ€ (without quotes).Note down your internal/LAN IP address.2. Goto the Beetel Router config page, http://192.168.1.1/main.html3. Click Advanced Setup â€“> NAT â€“> Virtual Servers â€“> Click â€œAddâ€4. Under Server Name check â€œSelect a Serviceâ€ and from the Drop Down Menu select â€œWeb Server (HTTP)â€.In â€œServer IP Addressâ€ box enter the IP address you noted in Step 1.Click on Save/Apply. You will get a message â€œSince port 80 is used, the DSL router WEB server port will be moved to 8080â€³, click â€œOKâ€.This basically forwards all your HTTP traffic on port 80 of your WAN IP, received by your router, to your Internal/LAN IP and moves the Admin Page of the Router to port 8080.5. Verify your setup by going to Anonymouse and entering this URL http://125.22.35.159(WAN IP) If it opens your WAMP Index Page, Congratulations youâ€™re done with configuring your Router.But it is still not working.. IT indeed works.. just goto any proxy http://250.eu/ enter your wan ip http://125.22.35.159(WAN IP) Hit the enter and it should show you your web server page. mssbusybee says:

November 3, 2008 at 4:44 pm
Hi there I atlast found out how to do that. The new modem 110BXI need not have an entry into the router for the port to be forwarded to. It works automatically. soroccoheaven says:

@mssbusybee if the beetel 110bx1 router is forwarding port without any configuration changes means you have configured it for DMZ mode or your modems firewall needs extra care. mag says:

January 6, 2009 at 5:05 pm

Hello guys ….. there have been lot of questions raised for increasing net speed … but is there anyway to increase the net speed for a particular IP within the airtel Wireless LAN. The motive being I want more speed than other guys using the same Beetel modem. DHCP is being used. Is there a way to set up high priority for a particular IP .. or something like that ?? ANWER says:

We are using Beetel router ADSL2. how i make it secure from stolen. does it is possible to protect from using other client/system.when router use in other system it should be authenticate from unauthorizes. does this facility available. so i want no other person use my router by connecting him/her system without my permission.

I have the same terrible modem. However, right now the problem is of my own making. I’ve forgotten the password, so could someone guide me how to do a hard reset to default settings. I have a backed up configuration file, which I can upload to restore the settings. Navneet says:

Hi,I was using UT-304 R2 4-port modem on airtel connection. Now I want to use same modem on BSNL. To change it’s setting for BSNL I need admin password. I know that default password is admin but it is not working I tried password as password also but it is also not working. Can someone help me on this? So that I can get inside the seetting of modem and chage those. [DiaBlo][As$@sIn] says:

May 6, 2011 at 8:22 am
[DiaBlo][As$@sIn] : Connect only the router from Port 1 to the computer. Open the router page at 192.168.1.1, login. Go to LAN setup and change the IP to 192.168.10.1, For DHCP also change it to 192.168.10.2 onwards. Save and reboot router. Now connect the modem to the Internet port and configure the router accordingly. TechGuy says:

Router Hack – How to hack ADSL router using NMAP

Cracking, Hacking, Kali Linux, Security
16 Comments
Asynchronous digital subscriber line (DSL or ADSL) modem is a device used to connect a computer or router to a telephone line which provides the digital subscriber line service for connectivity to the Internet, which is often called DSL or ADSL broadband. In this guide I will show you show you how to scan IP range for connected ADSL or DSL modem routers and find DSL ADSL router hack remotely. This guide applies to Windows, Linux or Mac, so it doesn’t matter what’s your Operating system is, you can try the same steps from all these operating systems. The term DSL or ADSL modem is technically used to describe a modem which connects to a single computer, through a USB port or is installed in a computer PCI slot. The more common DSL or ADSL router which combines the function of a DSL or ADSL modem and a home router, is a standalone device which can be connected to multiple computers through multiple Ethernet ports or an integral wireless access point. Also called a residential gateway, a DSL or ADSL router usually manages the connection and sharing of the DSL or ADSL service in a home or small office network.
Put this together with Wireshark hacking for http websites, you got a nightmare for the user behind that router as all their passwords and details can be tracked very easily.
What's in a DSL ADSL Router? - Click to expandWhat's in a DSL ADSL Router? - Click to expand
What’s in a DSL ADSL Router?
A DSL or ADSL router consists of a box which has an RJ11 jack to connect to a standard subscriber telephone line. It has several RJ45 jacks for Ethernet cables to connect it to computers or printers, creating a local network. It usually also has a USB jack which can be used to connect to computers via a USB cable, to allow connection to computers without an Ethernet port. A wireless DSL or ADSL router also has antennas to allow it to act as a wireless access point, so computers can connect to it forming a wireless network. Power is usually supplied by a cord from a wall wart transformer. It usually has a series of LED status lights which show the status of parts of the DSL or ADSL communications link:
Power light – indicates that the modem is turned on and has power.
Ethernet lights – There is usually a light over each Ethernet jack. A steady (or sometimes flashing) light indicates that the Ethernet link to that computer or device is functioning
DSL or ADSL light – a steady light indicates that the modem has established contact with the equipment in the local telephone exchange (DSL or ADSLAM) so the DSL or ADSL link over the telephone line is functioning
Internet light – a steady light indicates that the IP address and DHCP protocol are initialized and working, so the system is connected to the Internet
Wireless light – only in wireless DSL or ADSL modems, this indicates that the wireless network is initialized and working
Almost every ADSL DSL modem router provides a management web-page available via Internal network (LAN or Local area network) for device management, configuration and status reporting. You are supposed to login to the management web-page, configure a username password combination provided by your ISP (Internet service provider) which then allows you to connect to internet. The network is divided into two parts:
External Network
External network indicates the part where ADSL DSL modem routers connects to upstream provider for internet connectivity. Once connected to the ISP via a Phone line (ADSL DSL Modem routers can use conventional Copper Phone lines to connect to ISP at a much higher speed), the router gets an IP address. This is usually a Publicly routable IP address which is open to the whole world.
Internal Network
Internal network indicates the part where devices in Local Area Network connects to the ADSL DSL modem router via either Wireless or Ethernet cable. Most modem DSL ADSL Modem routers runs a DHCP server internally which assigns an Internall IP address to the connected device. When I say device, this can be anything from a conventional computer, a laptop, a phone (Android, Apple, Nokia or Blackberry etc.), A smart TV, A Car, NAS, SAN, An orange, A banana, A cow, A dragon, Harry Potter … I mean anything that’s able to connect to internet! So you get the idea. Each device get’s it’s own IP address, a Gateway IP and DNS entries. Depending on different DSL ADSL Modem router, this can be slightly different, but the idea remains the same, the DSL ADSL Router allows users to share internet connectivity. These DSL ADSL Modem Routers are like miniature Gateway devices that can have many services running on them. Usually they all use BusyBox or similar proprietary Linux applications on them. You want to know what a DSL ADSL Router can do? Here’s a list of common services that can run on a DSL ADSL Modem Router:
ADSL2 and/or ADSL2+ support
Antenna/ae (wireless)
Bridge/Half-bridge mode
Cookie blocking
DHCP server
DDNS support
DoS protection
Switching
Intrusion detection
LAN port rate limiting
Inbuilt firewall
Inbuilt or Free micro-filter
Java/ActiveX applet blocking
Javascript blocking
MAC address filtering
Multiple public IP address binding
NAT
Packet filter
Port forwarding/port range forwarding
POP mail checking
QoS (especially useful for VoIP applications)
RIP-1/RIP-2
SNTP facility
SPI firewall
Static routing
So-called “DMZ” facility
RFC1483 (bridged/routed)
IPoA
PPPoE
PPPoA
Embedded PPPoX login clients
Parental controls
Print server inbuilt
Scheduling by time/day of week
USB print server
URL blocking facility
UPnP facility
VPN pass-through
Embedded VPN servers
WEP 64/128/256 bit (wireless security)
WPA (wireless security)
WPA-PSK (wireless security)
That’s a lot of services running on a small device that are configured by nanny, granny, uncle, aunt and the next door neighbour, in short many non technical people around the world. How many of those configured badly? Left ports open left right and center? Didn’t change default admin passwords? Many! I mean MANY! In this guide we will use namp to scan a range of IP addresses, from output we will determine which are DSL ADSL Routers and have left their Management ports open to External Network. (again read top section to know which one is a external network). A typical ADSL Router’s Management interface is available via following URL:
http://10.0.0.1/
http://192.168.0.1/
http://192.168.1.1/
http://192.168.1.254/
etc.
This is the Management page for DSL ADSL modem router and it’s always protected by a password. By default, this password is written below a DSL ADSL modem router in a sticker and they are one of these combinations:
Username/Password
admin/admin
admin/password
admin/pass
admin/secret
etc.
A lot of the home users doesn’t change this password. Well, that’s ok. It doesn’t hurt much cause this is only available via a connected device. But what’s not OKAY is when users open up their management to the external network. All you need to know what’s the Public IP address for your target and just try to access this management page externally.
Installing NMAP
I use Kali Linux which comes with NMAP Preinstalled. If you are using Windows or Mac (or any other flavour of Linux) go to the following website to download and install NMAP.
Linux Installation:
For Ubuntu, Debian or aptitude based system NMAP is usually made available via default repository. Install NMAP using the following command:
sudo apt-get install nmap
For YUM Based systems such as Redhat, CentOS, install via
sudo yum install nmap
For PACMAN based systems such as Arch Linux, install via
sudo pacman -S nmap
Windows Installation:
For Windows Computers, download installer and run the executable. Link: http://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.46-setup.exe
Mac Installation:
For Mac users, download installer and install Link: http://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.46.dmg
Official NMAP site
You can read more about NMAP here: http://nmap.org/
Search for Vulnerable Routers
Now that we have NMAP sorted, we are going to run the following command to scan for ADSL Modem Routers based on their Banner on Port 80 to start our ADSL router hack. All you need is to pick an IP range. I’ve used an example below using 101.53.64.1/24 range.
Search from Linux using command Line
In Linux run the following command:
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1-255 -p80 -oG - | grep 'open' | grep -v 'tcpwrapped'
In Windows or Mac open NMAP and copy paste this line:
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1-255 -p80 -oG -
Once it finds the results, search for the word ‘open’ to narrow down results. A typical Linux NMAP command would return outputs line below: (and of course I’ve changed the IP details)
Host: 101.53.64.3 ()
Ports: 80/open/tcp//tcpwrapped///
Host: 101.53.64.4 ()
Ports: 80/open/tcp//http//micro_httpd/
Host: 101.53.64.9 ()
Ports: 80/open/tcp//tcpwrapped///

This was taking a long time (we are after all try to scan 256 hosts using the command above). Me being just impatient, I wanted to check if my Kali Linux was actually doing anything to ADSL router hack. I used the following command in a separate Terminal to monitor what my PC was doing… it was doing a lot …
tcpdump -ni eth0
That’s a lot of connected hosts with TCP Port 80 open. Some got ‘tcpwrapped’ marked on them. It means they are possibly not accessible.
Search from Windows, Mac or Linux using GUI – NMAP or Zenmap
Assuming you got NMAP installation sorted, you can now open NMAP (In Kali Linux or similar Linux distro, you can use Zenmap which is GUI version of NAMP cross platform). Copy paste the following line in Command field
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1/26 -p80 -oG -
another version of this command is using different representation of Subnet MASK.
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1-255 -p80 -oG -
Press SCAN Button and wait few minutes till the scan is over.
Once you have some results, then you need to find the open devices with open ports. In search Result page:
Click on Services Button
Click on http Service
Click on Ports/Hosts TAB (Twice to sort them by status)
As you can see, I’ve found a few devices with open http port 80.
It is quite amazing how many devices got ports open facing outer DMZ.
Access Management Webpage
Pick one at a time. For example try this:
http://101.53.64.3
http://101.53.64.4
http://101.53.64.129
You get the idea. If it opens a webpage asking for username and password, try one of the following combinations:
admin/admin
admin/password
admin/pass
admin/secret
If you can find the Router’s model number and make, you can find exact username and password from this webpage: http://portforward.com/default_username_password/ Before we finish up, I am sure you were already impatient like me as a lot of the routers had ‘tcpwrapped’ on them which was actually stopping us from accessing the web management interface to ADSL router hack. Following command will exclude those devices from our search. I’ve also expanded my search to a broader range using a slightly different Subnet MASK.
nmap -sS -sV -vv -n -Pn -T5 101.53.64.1/22 -p80 -oG - | grep 'open' | grep -v 'tcpwrapped'
In this command I am using /22 Subnet Mask with 2 specific outputs: I am looking for the work ‘open’ and excluding ‘tcpwrapped’ on my output. As you can see, I still get a lot of outputs.
Conclusion
You’ll be surprised how many have default username and passwords enabled. Once you get your access to the router, you can do a lot more, like DNS hijacking, steal username and passwords (for example: Social Media username passwords (FaceBook, Twitter, WebMail etc.)) using tcpdump/snoop on router’s interface and many more using ADSL router hack … Why did I write this guide? I get lots of feedback via Contact Us page. Here’s one for example:
As you can see Jhefeson probably has a legitimate reason to try and reboot this shared router, but he can’t just because he doesn’t have physical access to it. If this guide works, he can actually get access back.
There’s many things you can do after you’ve got access to a router. You can change DNS settings, setup a tcpdump and later snoop all plaintext passwords using wireshark etc. If you know a friends, family. colleague or neighbor who didn’t change their routers default password, let them know of the risks.
But I am not here to judge whether it should be done or not, but this is definitely a way to gain access to a router. So hacking is not always bad, it sometime is required when you loose access or a system just wouldn’t respond. As a pentester, you should raise awareness. Share this guide as anyone who uses a Linux, Windows, Mac can use this guide to test their own network and fix ADSL router hack issue.

well…why didn’t you explain the later part in detail like what to do when you get into the router. That would have made this tutorial a 5 star!

i am wondering what does the “-n” option does in nmap? i’ve googled it and didn’t come up with anything useful.
can you please explain what is the difference between DNS Resolver and DNS Resolution?

-n (No realizar resolución de nombres)
Le indica a Nmap que nunca debe realizar resolución DNS inversa de
las direcciones IP activas que encuentre. Ya que DNS es
generalmente lento, esto acelera un poco las cosas.

The best way for jhefeson to restart the the router is to go to his neighbour outdoor main electric power supply trip it off, wait 3 minutes and switch it on it back, wait 5-10 minutes for the router to back online. Plus the fact is the neightbour is out of town. Don’t worry about blackout.
Sometimes you need to be creative, not everything can be solved from ur machine.
Hope u can inform that to jhefeson. Glad if that could help.

Yeah it sounds very good but how can i use wireshark on this router?
Router have an public IP address like as 123.321.44.55
Ok i have access to the router
But how i can catch traffic and do MITM attacks on the user who is behind this router?
Router may be use NAT.

Pardon my ignorance, but where does the Nmap hacking part start? All you did was a scan for open ports/services on a network. If you want to know your home router’s IP, check the gateway on a client machine.
Great headline, but slightly dissapointing article.

Hello Tomas,
You got nmap scanning and saving IP in a file and hydra trying uname/passwd combination. I had to remove Hydra part that automates it.
No, you don’t really scan your own Gateway/Public IP. You can pick any IP range (/24) and scan it to see what’s in there. I happen to use an ADSL router so I scanned my Local ISP’s range. It was disappointing to see how many people mis-configured their home router. Cheers,
-BMO

Has anyone tried to login to their router with code?I want to automate some repetitive tasks like turning on/off the wireless radio and rebooting. I enabled telnet on the router and queried its commands, but there were none clearly labeled as such. Even the config file is encrypted so I can't modify that and reload. So, I assume I have to work the web cgi utility 192.168.1.1, and browse to the settings page and somehow send a click to a radio button and then hit apply button.I searched a bit through the forum but nothing stuck.Outside there are some iMacro recorders but I don't want my password encased in a 3rd party app.

I have done it for a few different routers (but in a different dialect of Basic).The problem is, every one is different in the way that they handle passwords.The first thing I do is install "Wireshark" and watch the traffic during a web browser session.That will give you the required steps.The rest is easy (sometimes).Jim

Ok, I guess network sniffing is the 1st step and then I use api to send the data bytes of my login.Thanks for the Wireshark link.

If the router uses a linux distribution for routers, usually BusyBox, you can normally do all that through telnet.Code:BusyBox v1.00 (2012.06.25-12:05+0000) Built-in shell (msh)Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.You can find help about the commands searching on google, there are PDFs with the commands listed etc.for example to bring up or down the wireless on my router (D-Link 2740B)ifconfig ath0 upifconfig ath0 downath0 is the interface (based on a Atheros chip, hence the name)Or you can go through HTTP as you are exploring now.

Unfortunately, my router only lists commands from the telnet dump and there is no direct documentation.The mfg(Actiontec) did make the firmware code available in a 150MB download
I hope it's well documented

Actiontec is linux based, GPL license. So you can to ask actiontec give u the source, its legal.By the way, i hear actiontec is stable on make connection , why u need reboot iI have plan to buy one skywalk wrote:Unfortunately, my router only lists commands from the telnet dump and there is no direct documentation.The mfg(Actiontec) did make the firmware code available in a 150MB download

I saw many Actiontec routers use BusyBox, are you sure yours doesn't ?In case you can try some commands from here and see if they works -> http://www.busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#commandsSorry if I insist, now I go and leave you alone

I need to force a reboot, since some users mentioned that improves upload speeds. I was experiencing the same slow downs.luis wrote:I saw many Actiontec routers use BusyBox, are you sure yours doesn't ?I haven't tried this yet, since I don't know how to invoke busybox on my router? I don't have a linux machine to debug.

After my last adventure with a Belkin F7D2401is now on hold until I find a backup original bootloader, I started trying OpenWRT on a D-Link DSL-2750u.After opening up the case (goodbye brand new warranty), the board looks remarkably similar to that of the DSL-2650nru.Logging into the router (telnet) and /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo, /proc/diskstats and "df" shows the followings: > cat /proc/cpuinfo

I found a way to boot into CFE recovery mode without opening the box.Turn off, push and hold the reset button, turn on,  keep holding the reset button until the power LED become red.go to http://192.168.1.1 and upload the new firmware. I have changed the firmware to Billion 7700N (a similar device) and every thing was functional. Now I want to update to openwrt. But it seems that I can not use ADSL and WLAN. Is it possible to add binary driver of adsl and wlan manually?Which version of OpenWRT is suitable for this device?

Sorry to resurrect a rather old post, but is there any movement on support for this modem?It is rather popular here in South Africa, our telecom monopoly here supplies them as an ADSL router.

Hi All, I have the same router as D-Link 2750u. After fighting for last 3 days, I found that Chaos Calmer release for profile A4001N will work fine for this router. Of course the router name will come as A4001N but I don't mind that :)As you might already know OpenWRT does not support ADSL. I am using the modem as a wireless extender. I am using this router(client) to connect to my main router (AP to which ADSL connection terminates) wirelessly and connect my desktop to the Client router through LAN. This was not working with the stock firmware.Thanks OpenWRT, you saved me some bucks, without this I would have to buy WiFi PCI  card.Try the firmware here, https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … fs-cfe.binFor flashing, the OEM firmware update through the web interface will not work. You have to use the CFE (bootloader) web interface, refer https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/bo … tp_server.Just to summarize the steps,- Assigning static ip to your machine which is connected to router using a LAN cable- power off the router, press the reset, power on the router *keeping* the reset pressed, release after few seconds when the light goes red- Point your browser to 192.168.1.1 (remember to clear caches of browser if you have problems in accessing the page)- upload the firmware through the web interface, it will take few minutes and restart- Remove the static ip for your machine and configure to do DHCP and EnjoyLet me know if you have any specific questions. I will contact the developers and see how to add support for this router in the future with the correct name. (Last edited by yousuf on 16 Nov 2015, 01:22)

so i think this has something to do with why it wont save settings "Sun Sep  6 17:55:08 2015 daemon.err mount_root: no jffs2 marker found"its from the "dmesg; logread" after a rebootany other places i could look for answers?

So yousuf dident suply his hardware revision and there are - C1 - T1 and T3there is a major difference in the flash layout of the stock firmware and the suggested A4001Nbut it dose boot into failsafe modei have gone as far as compiling the openwrt from the source and have made FW that boots into failsafe as well - based on the platfrom and device mentioned by yousufbut i dont understand enough to change the flash layoutif anyone can help ill be glad to post any info i haveBuilt the latest openwrt Designated Driver Bleeding Edge from source with A400 1N spec and it saves settings.issues after installing Luci Wi-Fi - WPA and WPA2 not working - wpad-mini package installedin luci it wont scan for available networks - can setup basic network AP open authentication (Last edited by acdcat on 25 Dec 2015, 23:30)

I live in South Africa and these devices are in most peoples homes.DLink DSL2750U Hardware Rev T1.Please let me know if there is anything I can submit from the console that would aid in getting around this.I suspect it might be to do with the amount of memory the device has, this error I believe is related to the config not being saved as ACDCat mentioned.daemon.err mount_root: no jffs2 marker found

So i have installed the latest trunk(generic-96328avng) on my DSL-2750U H/W T1 - board id = 96328ang.and i have the same problems - not able to save settings after reboot.Tue Mar  1 09:03:52 2016 kern.warn kernel: [   28.180000] jffs2: Newly-erased block contained word 0xf8326add at offset 0x00010000Tue Mar  1 09:03:52 2016 kern.warn kernel: [   28.188000] jffs2: Newly-erased block contained word 0xdeadc0de at offset 0x00000000Tue Mar  1 09:03:52 2016 kern.warn kernel: [   28.212000] done.Tue Mar  1 09:03:52 2016 kern.notice kernel: [   28.212000] jffs2: notice: (770) jffs2_build_xattr_subsystem: complete building xattr subsystem, 0 of xdatum (0 unchecked, 0 orphan) and 0 of xref (0 dead, 0 orphan) found.so i am gona try make an extRoot or extOverlay again - last time it worked(saves setings,extra storage) but wolden't always boot up.the usb i used was bit faulty i realize and i have serial console access now pin layout J 6 = pin1.VVC pin 2.GND pin3.TX pin4.

ok so this router has probably been branded differently in EU/USA/RU. and there are different H/W versionsDSL-2750U H/W T1 board id=96328angProfile=generic-96328avng-8M - 64K - jffs2.binpackages= b43, wpad-mini, + packages for extroot(blkid, block-mount,ext4-fs,usb-TESTING VARIOUS)if you use a jffs2 64k image and not a squashfs image there is no jffs2 errors.they dont have that image on the download section. so you have to build it and i coulden't get the chaos-calmmer15.1-imagebuilder to make a jffs2 image, so i used trunk source. root@OpenWrt:~# df -hFilesystem                Size      Used     Available    Use%  Mounted on/dev/root                 6.6M      4.2M      2.4M         64%       /tmpfs                    29.7M    536.0K     29.2M        2%       /tmptmpfs                   512.0K         0         512.0K       0%       /devroot@OpenWrt:~#its low on memory and usb not working ATM.But it saves setting and works as wi-fi repeater/extender/switch.

Developers recommend you use a squashfs image. That's the reason why the JFFS2 images are not built anymore.Install the official image, if you still get JFFS2 errors, telnet or SSH in and issue# mtd -r erase rootfs_data

ok so i have found out that there needs to be some kind off nvram erase or partition table reformatting... or in my case some kind of corruption...so i saw a "newwer" D-link firmware and was worried about usb not working so i loaded it.and usb works in stock firmwarebut when i try to re flash any (96328avng) - jffs2 or squashfs -8M.bin i get jffs2 errors block contained word..."(- mtd -r erase rootfs_data -)not working "soz bro"BUT then... i tryed to flash a 4M jffs2 image and it failed to flash constant red light.after that go back into CFE and flash jffs2 trunk and it saves setting again-EDIT: then it did the not allways booting up so i flashed a trunk image for 96328avng with only b42 and wpad-mini (no ext-root or usb drivers) squashfs.bin and its stable again...-hope that helps (Last edited by acdcat on 2 May 2016, 16:15)
