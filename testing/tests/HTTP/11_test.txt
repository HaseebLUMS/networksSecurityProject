Common Channel Signaling (CCS) : Any one group of channel carries the signal for the
other channels. B-channel rate : 64 Kbps
E.g.: ISDN PRI signaling carried on 24th channel in case of 1.544 Mbps (T1) &
16th channel in case of 2.048 Mbps (E1)
Channel Associated Signaling (CAS): It is similar to CCS & used only when BIT Rate is
2.048 Mbps hence used with E1 interface
B-channel rate : 64 Kbps
Robbed Bit Signaling (RBS): It is a per channel In-band signaling where the Least
significant bit in every 6th transmitted Information frame is removed & replaced by a
signaling bit. Maximum Transmission rate for each Bearer (B) channel is 56 Kbps

Daylight Saving Time (DST)
DST is convention of advancing clocks to utilize the maximum day light
Typically clocks are adjusted forward one hour near the start of spring and are
adjusted backward in autumn
Some countries like Europe, USA, Australia are following DST
ETERNITY supports DST and following DST mode selections are possible
When ETERNITY is installed in a country/region where DST is used, it is necessary to
synchronize the Real Time Clock of ETERNITY with the local time
98.
Daylight Saving Time (DST)
Scheduled DST Adjustment:
The RTC is advanced and set automatically according to DST convention. System will
automatically adjust DST at preset dates and time for the country/region where the
system is installed. Suppose ETERNITY is installed in Spain, DST Type 01
applicable to this country should be programmed as Scheduled DST
Manual DST Adjustment:
The RTC of ETERNITY is advanced and set backward manually according to the DST
convention of the country/region where ETERNITY is installed

Call Progress Tone Generation
(CPTG)
103.
Call Progress tones are audible tones sent from switching system i.e. PBX to calling
parties to show status of phone calls
CPTs are various tones generated on the various events of the system and each CPT
has a distinctive Tone frequency & Cadence (Ring pattern) as per standards of ITU
(International Telecommunication Union)
ETERNITY supports 40 CPT types which are assigned automatically on Region
selection
The tone generation period of each tone is also programmable
Call Progress Tone Generation (CPTG)
104.
On the Basis of specific frequency, modulating frequency and Cadence, the CPTs are
generated by ETERNITY
From Regional Settings one can select the Region according to which the different
CPTs will vary
ETERNITY supports 2 types of Dial Tone for each region selected
Dial Tone 1: Played when lifting the Handset
Dial Tone 2: Played when lifting the Handset & when ‘Store & Forward Dialing’ is
Done
Call Progress Tone Generation (CPTG)
105.
To demonstrate Call Progress Tones:
Enter SE Mode & then Dial 3541-Code
01: Dial Tone Type 1 07: Feature Tone
02: Dial Tone Type 2 08: Routing Tone
03: Ring Back Tone 09: Programming Tone
04: Busy Tone 10: Intrusion Tone
05: Error Tone 11: External Call Waiting Tone

RCOC
Its common for PBX to share the trunk for outgoing calls between group of
Extensions
If extension user of PBX is making OG call & called party does not answer the call or
busy, it is possible that called party might call back on the number received as CLI
As it is the incoming call, it will be routed to operator extension (Routing group) but
operator does n’t know who made the call. At this time RCOC feature is useful, it
will route the Incoming call to the original extension who dialed this number

Call Back on Trunk
171.
Call Back on Trunk Ports
‘Call Back on Trunk Ports’ is used to respond to missed calls on the trunk ports of
ETERNITY: CO, Mobile, BRI, T1E1PRI & SIP License of MOBILITY FEATURE SUITE
required
- When Call Back Feature is enabled on a Trunk port and there is a missed call on
that trunk port, ETERNITY determines if the calling number is eligible for a call
back or not.
- It calls back the same number or an alternative number programmed for that
number, either from the port on which it was received or from a different port,
depending on the programming.
- ETERNITY can be programmed to choose the most cost effective line to call back
the missed call numbers
Application: Employees at remote location can use this feature to have the ETERNITY
installed in their office call them back, there by saving on charges
172.
Programming Steps
Call Back must be Enabled on the Desired Trunk Port(s)
CLI of those callers whom the system should call back must be programmed in the ‘Call
Back Incoming Number List’
‘Call Back Timer’ programmed & when the caller disconnects within the Call Back Timer,
the Call Back will be applied for that number
‘Call Back On’ : Select whether the number which must be called back should be the
same CLI number or an alternate number
173.
Programming Steps
Number on which call back is to be made programmed in ‘Call Back Outgoing
Number List’
We can select whether the call back should be made using the same trunk port on
which call was received or an OGTBG. LCR can be Enabled for that OGTBG
Select a ‘Call Back Mode’ i.e. how the call should be routed when the call back is
answered by remote party : Built-In Auto Attendant , DISA or Operator
Call back feature can be activated on any of the trunk types i.e. CO, BRI, T1E1 (PRI),
Mobile, SIP trunk

Eternity can calculate the cost of calls made by a station
When a call is made the Call Cost Rate option & the Call Cost Time Schedule defined in
the TFT of the trunk is checked
According to the pulse rate option (1,2,3,4) and the area code the pulse rate type is known
Then the time of call is verified with the time schedule/zone defined T1, T2, T3 & T4
Duration and cost of 1st unit & Additional units of the pulse rate type corresponding to
that time schedule is then found and used to calculate the call cost
Business Feature License is Required for activation of this feature in ETERNITY V10
Call Cost Calculation (CCC)
227.
ETERNITY provides customization to calculate the cost for external calls automatically
& there is no need of additional Call Billing Software to calculate the cost for external
calls made from a Station
Unit charges and service charges in the CCC General Parameters have to be
programmed in the system.
In case of “Polarity Reversal” on CO or “Connect Signal” on T1E1 Trunk then following
parameters has to be programmed in the System Parameters: Area Codes ,Time
Zones, Pulse Rates
Eternity supports 4 Time Zones, 32 pulse rate types, 999 area codes

Amount/Minutes/Calls assigned on Trunk can be Changed to a Specified Value,
Manually or Automatically on Specified Date of Every Month
Trunk Budgeting
236.
If Call Budget type defined is Amount. Say suppose Rs. 9999 is defined. Cost of each call
will be calculated using CCC table.
Say 1 unit & also Additional unit = 180 sec = 1.10 Rs. = 3 minutes
Total calls:
1st call : 2 minutes = 1.10 Rs.
2nd call : 3 minutes = 1.10 Rs
3rd call : 4 minutes = 1.10 +1.10 = 2.20 Rs.
Total = 3.30 Rs.
In this manner when the amount exceeds Rs. 9999 calls wont be allowed to be made
from that trunk
Similarly if Call budget Type defined is in Minutes say 22222 minutes. Then if total call
duration of all calls made using that trunk exceeds 22222 minutes further calls wont be
enabled
Similarly Call budget Type - Calls say 2000 is defined then total 2000 calls will be
permitted for that trunk

AC Impedance test
243.
AC Impedance test
AC Impedance Test in ETERNITY helps you for a clear, audible and echo-free
speech over CO trunk.
This test will provide you to set the most appropriate values for CO Trunk
Parameters:
• AC Impedance
• CO Termination
• CO Line Type
You can conduct the test by:
• Making an outgoing call
• Or by ongoing incoming call
244.
AC Impedance test-OG call
Define the fields like
phone number on
which call is to be made
and through which port
245.
AC Impedance test-IC call
246.
AC Impedance Test
These are the values
generated after the
test
You can now apply these values
on any of the trunks

SBFT
(Station Basic Feature Template)
248.
Station Basic Feature Template
• Set of features that defines the basic features of a
station
• 50 different Station Basic Feature templates can be
assigned.
• SBFT can be assigned to following port types : SLT, DKP,
E&M, PRI, BRI, VOIP
249.
Time Table Toll Control Level 2: Call Privilege
Operator Toll Control Level 3: Call Privilege
COS Toll Control Level- Call Budget Consumed
Call Budget Enable Flag Store Outgoing Calls
Toll Control Level 0 (WH , BH & NH):
Call Privilege
Store Incoming calls
Toll Control Level 1: Call Privilege
Parameters configured in
Station Basic Feature Template (SBFT)
250.
Station Basic Feature Template
8 Different Time
Tables
251.
Station Basic Feature Template
20 different Operators, E.g. : When a station
dials 9 call is routed to the routing group
defined as operator in the SBFT for the
particular zone
252.
Group of features that can be flexibly assigned to different users according to the
Requirement
Different COS can be assigned for a Station and trunk in different Time Zones as per
selected in its SBFT & TFT
Almost 56 different features and 20 different COS can be configured as per
Requirement
Assign the COS level in the desired SBFT Time Zone wise & assign the SBFT to Station
Class Of Service
253.
When call budget is enabled for a station it limits the out going calls made from the
Station according to the budget assigned to the station
The Budget exhaust period is 1 month (fixed)
How it Works??????
When an extension allotted call budget makes a call, system checks its budget
If consumed amount is within the budget limit, system allows to make call according
to the toll control levels defined for the station
After the call ends system calculates & adds the call amount to the extension’s
account
If the consumed amount exceeds the budget limit, system will consider the call
budget exhausted
Hence the extension user will be allowed to make calls only as per the Toll control
assigned for the call budget consumed state

An expense control feature that enables to define a call privilege to an extension
Call privilege types:
No calls Local calls
Regional calls National calls
All calls Limited calls 1,2,3
International calls
The allowed & denied list for these can be programmed by selecting the
corresponding privilege in the Regional settings (Jeeves)
Toll control is not applicable for Emergency numbers
Toll Control
259.
Toll control level 0 : Time zone based. It supports an additional call privilege called
Limited calls. The allowed and denied numbers are programmed in the corresponding
external number list
Toll control level 1 : Default privilege- Local Calls
Toll control level 2 : Default privilege- National Calls
Toll control level 3 : Default privilege- No Calls
Level 1,2 & 3 are not Time zone based
Toll control-Call budget consumed: Applicable when Call budget is enabled for extension
& the call budget assigned has already been consumed. In this case the extension will
be enabled to make calls according to the call privilege defined in this field
Toll Control Levels

Toll Control Levels
Toll control
level options
261.
Allows an extension to change his Toll control level
Allows the SA/Operator to change the toll control level assigned to extensions
Assign a station COS group with Dynamic Lock and the Decrement Dynamic Lock
Timer for Internal Calls enabled
Dynamic lock : Manual
Extension user sets dynamic lock manually by entering the user password & selecting
the toll control level Or
The operator sets dynamic lock manually by entering the extension number and
selecting the toll control level.
Dynamic lock timer set to 00
Dynamic Toll Control
262.
Dynamic lock : Automatic
Allows an extension or an operator to select a desired toll control level and set the
Dynamic lock timer (01 to 99 minutes)
How it Works?????
When set, System waits for the duration of timer. At end of each outgoing call made
during this period the system will restart timer again. If no call made till expiry of timer,
system will change the toll level back to the previous level
If ‘Decrement Dynamic Lock Timer - Internal Calls’ is enabled in the COS of the
extension and an internal call is made during the period of the lock timer then the
system will start decrement of the timer and will change the toll control level to the
previous level on expiry of the timer.
263.
When Dynamic Lock – Manual is set (Timer set to 00), the extension user / Operator
must dial the Feature access code to restore the previous Toll Control Level
When Dynamic Lock – Automatic is set (Timer set to desired number of minutes),
the system will restore the previous Toll Control Level at the end of the Timer
The default User Password should be changed so as to enable the Dynamic Lock
Feature for the particular user / Extension.

Matrix call logging
The following data will be logged from Matrix Eternity. The program can extract several data fields: Direction, Direction, Extension, Phone, Call time, Call duration (s), Call duration, Sequence number, Authority code, Trunk, Cost, Caller phone, Remarks.
DOWNLOAD CALL LOGGING SOFTWARE!
Your telephone system (or PBX, PABX) produces a packet of data (a call record) after every phone call your company or office makes through it. These call records contain important information about each call, including whether it was an incoming call, and outgoing call, or another type, such as an internal (extension to extension) call.
Call log records from Matrix Eternity contain information about the caller phone and the dealed phone, as well as extra information such as the call duration, the time of the call, and other information, such as which telephone line (trunk) was used to carry the call.
The usual practice of Matrix Eternity call logging involves capturing these call records, parsing it, and storing them in a database, and their subsequent retrieval by way of a reporting interface.

First Nighter: London's 'Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense,' 'Mojo,' 'From Here to Eternity'
11/15/2013 06:06 am ET
Updated
Jan 23, 2014
London -- As popular as P. G. Wodehouse and his creations, suave manservant Jeeves and first-prize twit Bertie Wooster, have been for almost 100 years, they've apparently never toddled onto a West End stage until--wait for it!--now.
At long last they've been transferred to the Duke of York's by the Goodale Brothers Robert and David in a bit of all right play.
It's not, pleasant to report, the insufficient Andrew Lloyd Webber By Jeeves musical.
This one's happily called Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense.
Not to put too fine a point on it--well, fine, let's put too fine a point on it--the outing is, as the title states outright, perfect nonsense.
Putting a finer point on it, one might say Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense will be perfect nonsense for those, like this reviewer, who love the 11 Jeeves-Wooster novels and 30 stories as well as for those who don't know them but are discovering them in this manner.
For those familiar with the antics but don't twig to them, the Goodales' adaptation is so good that whatever you haven't cared for to date is captured grandly here, thank goodness.
So for those in that forlorn camp, consider this notice fair warning.
What's wonderful about this version is that all the usual participants are included, don't you know, and played with such stamina your head will spin.
Besides Jeeves (Matthew Macfadyen) and Bertie (Stephen Mangan), there are Gussie Fink-Nottle, Madeline Bassett, Aunt Dahlia, Sir Watkyn Bassett and one or two others--all of them essayed, thanks to startlingly quick costume changes (Alice Power the designer), by either Macfadyen or Mark Hadfield.
No Wodehouse advocates need be informed that the plot couldn't be more insipid, which is, needless to say, its charm.
Here we have Bertie dispatched by Aunt Dahlia to purloin a silver cow creamer that she had her eyes on before Sir Watkyn Bassett bought it.
There's also a spot of bother between Gussie and Madeline into the middle of which Bertie gets--with everything brought to a gleeful conclusion through Jeeves's deft machinations.
The Goodales have infinitely enhanced the undertaking by deciding Bertie has been convinced he should be recounting his (mis)adventure from a stage.
Thrilled with the prospect of becoming an actor in his own story, he launches himself into the task and shortly accepts Jeeves's assistance in supplying scenery and, of course, appearing as the other figures in the diversion.
The Wodehouse novels are loved for the author's beguiling use of language.
On the page, the pretzel-like twists Bertie gets into have to be imagined, of course.
Here, directed with merriment by Sean Foley, they've been brought to life and are a hoot to see.
Nevertheless, let's just say the piece--which might have been shortened by a few minutes, but who's counting? -- remains, as a friend of mine suggests, an idiom's delight.
*************************************************************************************************
Jez Butterworth's Mojo was initially produced at the Royal Court, where 39 years earlier John Osborne's Look Back in Anger changed the face of British drama.
So you might say the Royal Court is the go-to establishment for angry young men, six of whom are looking back not only in anger but in fear now that Mojo is revived at the Harold Pinter.
These disgruntled fellows of 1958 hang out in one capacity or another at Ezra's Atlantic, a Dean Street club, where the hot attraction is a performer called Silver Johnny (Tom Rhys Harries) who works in a silver lamé suit.
Silver Johnny is such a crowd magnet that his services are sought by rival club owner Sam Ross.
Though Sam Ross is the primary cause of the Mojo turmoil, he goes unseen by club under-manager Mickey (Brendan Coyle), hyper-nervous Potts (Daniel Mays), agitated Skinny (Colin Morgan), frightened Sweets (Rupert Grint, first-timing on stage after the Harry Potters) and nasty son of owner Baby (Ben Whishaw).
The lads fight among themselves for two acts, their contentions exacerbated by the fate that's befallen owner Ezra at the hands of Ross or his minions.
Though Butterworth puts them through more two-act internecine frays than seems necessary, he keeps their tangling urgent on Ultz's two-layer set--first act in an office with several jukeboxes about, second act in the gloomy high-ceilinged downstairs room.
Along the way, there's the hint that one of these jittery pals is gaming the others, and for some viewers it may be quite easy to spot the culprit.
While the mean-streets characters aren't exactly unfamiliar (there's a flash, too, of Harold Pinter's Caretaker and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross--note the Ross reference), they remain worth watching throughout.
A good part of the reason that surely includes long-time Butterworth collaborator, director Ian Rickson: Actors love to sink their teeth into and get their mitts on these kinds of roles.
With this Mojo, there's an abundance of effective teeth-sinking and mitts-grabbing.
*********************************************************************
If the music in musicals is the criterion by which an enterprise is going to be judged, then From Here to Eternity with a Tim Rice-Stuart Brayson score would have to be declared solidly mediocre.
There are a couple of rousing numbers.
A Nashville ditty called "Ain't Where I Want to Be Blues" could actually become a chart item in the right circumstances.
Also lively are "Fight the Fight" and "G Company Blues" (what, another blues?) and a closer about "the men of '41," referring to the Armed Forces officers and enlisted men who died or just barely lived through the attack on Pearl Harbor.
Most of the other songs are lackluster, and it's notable that Tim Rice still has great trouble writing a meaningful love song.
This, of course, is a sizable problem in a situation where two torrid love stories unfold.
Yet, there's much to recommend in this From Here to Eternity, the first of which is that the Bill Oakes libretto is truer in tone to the 1951 James Jones novel than the 1953 film.
The explanation: The limits on what could be filmed then and what can be depicted today have greatly changed.
For instance, a sequence set in a gay bar where American soldiers rob the gay regulars during sexual encounters shows up here where it couldn't on Fred Zinnemann's '50s celluloid.
The basic story, sets and costumes by Soutra Gilmour, is the same, of course--the illicit love affair between officer-hating first sergeant MiIt Warden (Darius Campbell) and unhappy officer's wife Karen Holmes (Rebecca Thornhill), the romance between former-boxer-former-bugler private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Robert Lonsdale) and good-hearted but cynical prostitute Lorene (Siubhan Harrison), and the tribulations of plucky but eventually broken private Angelo Maggio (Ryan Sampson).
As directed by Tamara Harvey, all performers bring the requisite grit to their assignments--Campbell singing beautifully; Lonsdale not only singing but playing guitar and, as the story demands, eventually the bugle (he seemed to be playing it and not someone near him behind a scrim); Sampson warbling with gusto and conjuring much sympathy for Maggio; Thornhill and Garrison effectively playing the disillusion experienced by women in wartime.
The hero here, however, may be choreographer Javier De Frutos.
He's decided that the frustration felt by soldiers waiting to get into combat affects their entire physicality.
He's staged their movement accordingly, particularly when he gets to the boxing that's G Company's pride.
And the men of the From Here to Eternity chorus are more than up to the demands De Frutos puts on them.
But back to the music: It's undoubtedly impossible to set a musical in Hawaii without putting show-tune-savvy listeners in mind of South Pacific.
There's really no flattering comparison here, but if this From Here to Eternity isn't Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, it's very particularly James Jones, and that's not bad.

Oh, how I miss you, dear Plum, more than I ever will any relative, especially given that many of them are in the Aunt Agatha mode anyway! It is crazy, that my eyes well up with tears as I read the passage above. Such is your penetration into my soul - you have been the ultimate fount of solace whenever I needed some, and even when I did not. You are the greatest of them all. Will there ever be another like you? I doubt very much. But then, what is the need? You live on, for eternity, in the hearts and minds of millions like me. Thank you and all that!

Another PGW delight is the ‘Jeeves and Wooster’ TV video series with Hugh Laurie & Stephen Fry. Its music by the great Anne Dudley’s is often my morning wake up call to duty reveille. As an overseas win-win private diplomat operating on my own dime, I strive valiantly to be a modern day Jeeves with my “cointerlocutors”. I can seldom glimpse
.
The Heights,
.
but the Eternal Jeeves gives me the inspiration to keep trying, which in itself is a delight. Indeed, Jeeves is my hero.
.
Bertie: “Jeeves, do you know everything?”
Jeeves: “ . . . I really don’t know Sir.” (Do the math re Infinity & Theory of Everything, etc)
.
Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I watch the opening scene [In Court After the Boat Races] with a hung over Bertie appearing before Magistrate Watkyn Bassett, CBE on The Bench at Bosher Street Court:
.
“Thisss is one of the most shameful cases ever to come before this bench! In alll my years as a magistrate, I have seldom heard a tale of such heinous indigence.”
“Arrgrruurz”
“Be QUITE!”
This parasite can think of no better way to end a night of hooliganism…
[Soon, Jeeves enters Bertie life, and revives him]:
“If you will just drink this sir. It’s a little preparation of my own invention. Gentlemen have told me they find it extremely invigorating after a late evening.”
“Ahghh… gurgle…hrumfz …brmnx…rgahhq….I say!…ahuh…
I
SAY!
You’re engaged!”
“Thank you Sir. My name is Jeeves.”
“I say Jeeves, what an extraordinary talent!”
“Thank you, Sir.”
“Uh, could one enquire, …brbuh…”
“I’m sorry Sir.”
“No no, ‘couse not.”
“I’m not at liberty to divulge the ingredients.”
“No no, no of course not. Secrets of the guild and all.”
“Precisely Sir!”
“Mmm…
Hmm…
HAH!”
***
Indeed, all diplomats, The Economist readers, the Chinese, AND EVERYBODY ELSE should diligently study P.G. Wodehouse. After all, is falls to people such as found upon these screens to bring civilization to the barbarians of our planet.

For me, Bertram Wilberforce ("Bertie") Wooster is one of Wodehouse's most endearing, yet at times most irritating, characters. Endearing, because he embodies so many attractive personality traits: good humour, perseverance, generosity, unshakeable loyalty to his friends. He would irritate, because one cannot avoid the feeling that, were he made of sterner stuff, he would resist those—mainly old school friends and aunts—who unscrupulously take advantage of his good nature and land him in the soup. At the same time, one is well aware that if Bertie was not so spineless, there would be no story.
. . . mentally somewhat negligible but he has a heart of gold
But the sad fact is—for let's not beat about the bush here—that Bertie is a chump, a fathead. Well-meaning, to be sure, but not one of Nature's thinkers. We may assume that he was born with the usual complement of parents, one mother, one father, but we know little about them, save that his father had several siblings, from one of whom—his uncle George—Bertie has inherited sufficient wealth as to make gainful employment unnecessary. This is fortunate because it is difficult to imagine how Bertie would have survived if he had had to work for his living. Not that he is without a certain native cunning.
In Ring for Jeeves, the only Jeeves story that does not feature Bertie, he goes back to school to learn how to fend for himself in the event of a social revolution and, by dint of cheating, succeeds in winning the sock-darning prize. Of course, being Bertie, he is found out and expelled!
You know your Shelley, Bertie.
Oh, am I?
Although not averse to the odd spot of cheating, Bertie adheres rigidly to a "Code of the Woosters". This has two fundamental tenets: never refuse help to a pal in need and never contradict or offend a female. So, when a friend finds himself in a spot of bother and turns to Bertie for help, he can be sure that help will be forthcoming. And when the spot of bother involves, as it so often does, the friend's fiancée, we can be sure that, thanks to the second part of the Code, it will not be long before Bertie is himself in a spot (or two) of bother. Fortunately, Jeeves is usually on hand to save Bertie from the clutches of the law, amorous young women, or furious young men.
Wilberforce, by the way, was the name of an unfancied horse that Bertie's soon-to-be father had the good fortune to back to win the Grand National steeplechase in the year of Bertie's birth.

I had proof of Wodehouse's durability the day I discovered my teen-aged son, computer in sleep mode, guffawing at a collection of Jeeves stories, then found my 80-year-old father keeping vigil at my dying mother's hospital bed, softly chuckling over his Wodehouse omnibus.

From Right Ho, Jeeves:
"Don't blink at me in that obscene way," she [Aunt Dahlia] said. "I wonder, Bertie," she proceeded, gazing at me as I should imagine Gussie would have gazed at some newt that was not up to sample, "if you have the faintest conception how perfectly loathsome you look? A cross between an orgy scene in the movies and some low form of pond life. I suppose you were out on the tiles last night?"
"I attended a social function, yes," I said coldly. "Pongo Twistleton's birthday party. I couldn't let Pongo down. Noblesse oblige."
"Well, get up and dress."
I felt I could not have heard her aright.
"Get up and dress?"
"Yes."
I turned on the pillow with a little moan, and at this juncture Jeeves entered with the vital oolong. I clutched at it like a drowning man at a straw hat. A deep sip or two, and I felt—I won't say restored, because a birthday party like Pongo Twistleton's isn't a thing you get restored after with a mere mouthful of tea, but sufficiently the old Bertram to be able to bend the mind on this awful thing which had come upon me.

I dream of having flown Spitfires over Kent during the Battle of Britain. I fantasize that I took that bullet for King ("YOU are part of the Dream, now,Son . . . .") In reflective moments I KNOW I would have told Sylvia Plath, "Sylvie, [we would have been very close]
this is great poetry, I'll get it published and don't even think of taking your life!" In certain reveries I say, "Look, Jack, Texas is important but your personal well-being matters a lot more to me. Tell Gov. Connally you can't make it."
But, in my rarest moments, I picture myself having tea with Bertie and Gussie Fink-Nottle while Jeeves shimmers in and out of the room. ("Tell me, Jeeves, just when was the Golden Bull issued?"
. . . "In 1356, Sir. At Nuremberg. Would you care for some sugar?")
They all, idiots to a person except Jeeves, inhabited such a pleasantly inconsequential world! No more muss or fuss than whether plaids were back in fashion.
What a time! Hispano-Suiza motor-cars, Jesse Matthews at the Cinema and Jack Buchanan on stage. Afternoon tea at the Savoy, J.B. Priestly mumbling on the wireless and associated morons in impeccable dress gathered to ascertain whether the stars are, indeed, God's daisy-chain.
So, the first Jeeves' story was in 1915. Asquith was PM. Can you tell it from the story? Wodehouse's best work was done when Ramsey Mac and Baldwin alternated as premier -- is there anything he wrote that even suggests either of these?
Today's humor has two characteristics. First, it is all about politics (e.g. Stephen Colbert and John Daley.) Secondly, it is not funny. Clever, shrewd and cynical, yes, but, otherwise, about as funny as a baby's funeral.
Jeeves and Bertie ARE funny and will remain so regardless of politics. They are the droll lunacy of self-involved twits, a thing that custom cannot stale -- even if Trump becomes president. Wodehouse's humor was not a parasite of his era and its politics. His laughter rose to the heavens in a gentle dirigible made of paper-mache, good-humor and practiced gullability.
Long may his gentle wit survive.
p.s. I coined the phrase "not the brightest bulb in the chandelier" months ago and first used it here. Royalties?

Actually, I typed heedlessly for, I used it quite
a few years ago. I was weary of "Not the sharpest knife in the drawer," which has been around since the '90s, and tried to think up an alternative.
The "knife" metaphor struck me as clumsy, anyway, because it does not denote intelligence. However, a "bright" bulb does this -- haven't we long referred to a rather slow person as a "dim bulb?"
So, being a plodding sort of bird, I tried several metaphors, not all of which worked ("Not the scaliest fish in the sea" -- that went nowhere!) and settled on the chandelier.
I am quite sure of my pioneering lexicography and if your Mr. Spencer Duhm persists in his literary claim-jumping then I will have no choice but to call him out on the field of honor.
My choice of weapons is a hardbound copy of "Barlett's Familiar Quotations," to be hurled at one another at twenty paces.

Apart from the excellent humour, remember that these books were written at a time of major class and ideological warfare.
The idea that a "lower class" Jeeves could be well educated while willing to love and sustain an upper-class twit must have been very reassuring - and contained an element of truth.
If you want an equally entertaining, but much more incisive, take on the same subject, check out The Admirable Crichton by J. M. Barrie (who also wrote Peter Pan).
Especially the 1957 film if you can find it.

I love his writing too, but mentioning Woodhouse's ignorance of world wars without bringing up his broadcasts for a Nazi radio network seems a bit rich. His work may be pure joy, but his life's a sad warning of what can happen to a Bertie without Jeeves.

Seriously? He was interned because he lived in France - had lived there since 1934 or so - and made 6 broadcasts to the US, which wasn't in the war yet, that were comic, non-political and about the oddities of life as an internee. He regretted it. It's important to note that Wodehouse was raised in Britain but lived most of his life in the US or France.

A subtle charm of Wodehouse was that his hero is filthy rich aristocrat.
It would be nice to imagine oneself rich and not having to work like Bertie Wooster, isn't it? But in reality, our place is more like Jeeves, only without his wits.

Nice piece but you leave out an extremely important literary device: Wodehouse has you identify with Bertie and then reveals to you, as the reader, that Bertie has been a complete idiot and has been manipulated by Jeeves. Doing this required great skill because readers don't like to think of themselves as idiots. Compare Conan Doyle's attempt to write a Holmes story as Holmes: didn't work because the magic disappears when it's not in Watson's voice. Wodehouse absorbs you into Bertie's head and presents that view with such genial, buoyant affection that you become more invested in the solution to Bertie's conundrum than in the mishaps of Bertie's inevitable failures and comeuppances. Jeeves is the instrument by which you as reader attain resolution to the problems besetting Bertie and Wodehouse hits exactly the right tone: Bertie may get angry but only temporarily and always in the context that he realizes as well that Jeeves has solved the problem. This writing ability is often unremarked - people focus on Wodehouse's sparkling sentences and wit - but he pulls off a remarkable thing: he makes you identify with an idiot who wanders about singing "47 Ginger-Headed Sailors" and then has you revel in having your character revealed as that idiot. Even making the audience identify with your creation is hard but having them identify with your creation in such a deviously delightful manner is artistry.

Bertie's not an idiot though- he just has an upper class response to a privileged education, which is to say he has a pretty good idea of the kinds of things he's supposed to know about.

You've put your finger on one of the most hilarious aspects of Bertie....he knows he's SUPPOSED to know things, but his knowledge is so charmingly fragmentary and half-remembered:
-- "I'm not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare who says that it's always just when a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with the bit of lead piping."
-- "It's a topping morning, Jeeves."
"Decidedly, sir."
"Spring and all that."
"Yes, sir."
"In the spring, Jeeves, a livelier iris gleams upon the burnished dove."
"So I have been informed, sir."
