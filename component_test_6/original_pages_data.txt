ftp server not responding after log in
Ask Question
0
So my problem is that I have a FTP server running on my NAS behind a router.
When trying to log in through the NAS 192.168.1.X address I can connect and list the files but when accessing from my external static IP address I get the following:
MyLinuxUserName@myPC:~$ ftp my.example.com
Connected to my.example.com.
220---------- Welcome to Pure-FTPd [privsep] [TLS] ----------
220-You are user number 1 of 10 allowed.
220-Local time is now 12:32. Server port: 21.
220-IPv6 connections are also welcome on this server.
220 You will be disconnected after 10 minutes of inactivity.
Name (my.example.com:MyLinuxUserName): MyServerLoginName
331 User MyServerLoginName OK. Password required
Password:
230 OK. Current restricted directory is /
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful

ftp> cd Volume_1
250 OK. Current directory is /Volume_1
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful
150 Connecting to port 47866
And then it's stuck.
For some reason it will allow me to authenticate but then it will not show me any other file contained in the Volume_1/ folder. (yes the correct permissions are set).
I'm not sure if I'm in the right place but I would sure appreciate some help in solving this really annoying error.
I am running a Dlink DNS-320L NAS behind a ASUS RT-N66U router with a static IP address aimed at the router with port 80, 20 and 21 forwarded to the NAS.

You've run into one of the many reasons that FTP has no business being used today. Use sftp instead and all will be well.

I admit I'm probably as smart as an Idiot when it comes to network but I'm not sure how.. since my NAS don't have a option to use that.... There is only a checkbox "Allow SSL/TLS connections only" in the FTP settings area...

Setup and Tweak Your New Asus RT-AC66U or N66U Router! (partially OT)
Asus has been doing an increasingly impressive job in the "home" WiFi router market. With impressive performance approaching enterprise class routing capability and second-to-none Wifi performance, (for an unmanaged single unit) they're hard to beat for the enthusiast market. By using something like TomatoUSB firmware you can get many enterprise-class features. While I may write an article in the future on Tomato or DD-WRT tweaking, I'm going to go through the setup here using the new "Merlin" firmware. Eric Sauvageau, the author of the modified firmware, states of this:
"The primary goals of this project are to fix bugs, add a few basic
features and tweaks to the original firmware.
This firmware will try to
remain as close as possible to the original firmware."
Sounds good to me. I've spent alot of time with Tomato and DD-WRT on my home network, and a change of pace might be nice. Also, you get the piece of mind that you're using mainly the manufacturers' code on this newer hardware.
Note: Some ideas covered in this article may apply to other consumer or enterprise level hardware.
Assumptions:
You have purchased either a RT-AC66U or RT-N66U (Update 7/6/13: RT-AC56U now supported asw well)
You have backed up, memorized, or otherwise, your old router settings
You're comfortable with the basics; I'm not going to re-cover the manual
You have power and an internet connection. Setup will be easier and more reliable if you also have a house or apartment, which you should be inside of during this tutorial.
Let's get to work:
Connect the router as described in the manual. If you have a DHCP server (other than the one on the router from your ISP) you'll either need to temporarily disable it or ensure it's assigning the 192.168.1.x range excluding .1.
Perform the initial "Quick Internet Setup" wizard
After/if it prompts you to update firmware, go ahead and do so.
If desired, (and some of my steps will assume this is done) download the "Merlin" firmware from here. In the interface click "Administration->Firmware Upgrade" and specify the path to the trx file.
Now that we've upgraded, let's highlight important setup steps. I'm not going to cover the specifics of your environment, just things I recommend you pay attention to. First, navigate to "Wireless->WPS"  and set it to "OFF". Most implementations of WPS are NOT secure at all. For more information, see: This episode of the wonderful Security Now! podcast or this lifehacker article. There are many ways to get a complex WiFi key to nearly any device securely.
Navigate to "Wireless->Professional" and check the "Tx Power adjustment" and reduce it if possible. (Some experimentation required) Make sure you use the dropdown and do both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. Lowering your broadcast power will slightly shorten the range so you aren't broadcasting to your neighbors (polite) and may lengthen your hardware life. (See effect @ "Tools->Radios Temperature")
If you disabled the DHCP server, make sure you go to "LAN->DHCP Server->Log DHCP Queries" and hit "Disable".
To log stats, insert a USB thumb drive. It can be tiny and slow if you want. Navigate to "System Log->General Log" hit "Refresh". Copy the contents down and search them for the mount messages. In my case, the only message was "Jan  3 18:47:16 hotplug[1032]: USB vfat fs at /dev/sda mounted on /tmp/mnt/1GB", and that corresponds to @ /mnt/1GB for short since /mnt is a symlink to /tmp/mnt. Write this down.
Navigate to "Tools->Other Settings" and set "Traffic history location" to "Custom location".
Set "Save history location" to the value you wrote down in step 8, select "Create or reset data files" (if this is the first time you have done this on this disk) and hit "Apply".
(Added 1/12/13) Unless you're using STP with your other switches, etc. navigate to  "Lan->Switch Control" and set "Spanning-Tree Protocol" to "Off".  Cool that it supports STP though! (Update 10/11/2013: There has been some confusion on this, so to simplify: If you have more than one switch not including this Asus router, leave STP enabled. Otherwise, disable it. If you would like to better understand see this.)
(Added 1/20/13) If you aren't using IPv6 (yet), navigate to "IPv6"->"Auto Configuration Setting"->"Enable Router Advertisement" and set it to "Disable".
(Added 1/20/13) Let's disable some other services that most people won't need. Unless you're using this router as a filesharing and/or DLNA device, do the following: Navigate to "USB Application"->"Media Server"->"Enable DLNA Media Server" and set it to "Off".
(Continued from #13) Navigate to "USB Application"->"Network Place/Samba Share"->"Disable Share" and click "OK" to confirm disabling the service.
(Continued from #13) Navigate to "USB Application"->"Miscellaneous Setting" and turn off "Force as Master Browser" and "Set as WINS Server" and click "Apply".
(Added 2/4/2013) Recommended: Though I haven't tested (update 6/7, it's fine as of now, so if you need UPnP go ahead) to see if this firmware is impacted by the recent discovery that a substantial number of firmwares expose UPnP to the external interface of the router(!!) I still recommend turning it of if it's feasible. This means you'll have to forward ports manually, but if you're reading this I suspect you know how to do so anyhow. (If not, comment as such and perhaps I'll write an article about it) To disable the UPnP service navigate to "Advanced Settings->WAN->Internet Connection->Basic Config->Enable UPnP" and set it to "No" Update 5/27/2013:  How to forward ports:
To forward ports, first determine what ports your service/application uses. While a search for "(Service) forward ports" generally returns the  ports needed for that service, you can also use something like portforward.com to look it up. Note that the port spaces of TCP and UDP protocols are separate, so make sure you get the protocol right and know that the port numbers can overlap. There are some pre-baked shortcuts in the Merlin/Asus firmware on the port forwarding page (listed in the next step) that will populate the ports for you; it may be worth checking those out to save some time.
After you determine your ports, open the manage interface of your Asus router and navigate to "Wan->Virtual Server/Port Forwarding"
Ensure "Enable Port Forwarding" is set to "Yes".
Under "Port forwarding List" type the name of your application under "Service Name". This entry is cosmetic only and serves to identify this forward.
Under "Port Range" enter the port(s) needed for this application. To open a range, separate the lowest port and the top port with a ":". For example, to open up ports 80 through 90 you would put "80:90". You can also put non-joining port ranges on the same rule by adding more ports after a comma. For example, to open ports 80 and 90, you would put "80,90".
On "Local IP" put the IP address of the machine hosting the service you would like to expose to the internet. If you don't know this address and you're (as default) using the DHCP server on the router you can find the address by going to the DHCP management on your router.
On "Local Port" you generally want to put exactly what you put under "Port Range". The exception to this rule would be if you want to expose an internal port as a different port externally.
Under "Protocol" select the proper protocol; TCP, UDP, or Both. Again, note that selecting "Both" would result in both sets of ports being opened.
Click the plus icon "Add/Delete" and then click "Apply" at the bottom. Note that if your IP address changes then you'll need to update the rule.
(Added 7/20/2013,Critical) A vulnerability has been discovered with the AICloud software. There is an official firmware that has been released that is reported but not confirmed to fix the problem, but that includes a very poor wifi driver so I would not recommend its use unless you have no 5ghz WiFi clients. The Merlin 372_30_2 build does not address this problem because Eric based it on a pre-release 372 version that didn't yet include the fix. (Confusing versioning by Asus..) If you don't run that new stock FW make sure you disable the AICloud! (AICloud->Smart Disk/Cloud Access) Update 7/24/13: There is a Merlin build that addresses this issue now available. See below for links.  Update 2/18/14: There have been stories about either this exploit and/or a potentially newly found exploit involving FTP and the AI cloud feature. I think the best advice at this time is from Eric (the author of the firmware).  The point: Because it is uncertain if this is entirely based on the old vulnerability, disable these features until the full nature of the exploit is disclosed and confirmed fixed.   Update 3/16/14: This should be fixed with the newest build (374.40) but frankly I would still leave them off.
(Added 11/3/2013) If you notice that your WiFi continues to loose connectivity and you need to reboot the router to fix it, try naming your 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz radios differently. I've noticed that some dual band devices (the iPad specifically) will bounce between frequency spectra and this will cause the Asus to become confused and stop relaying requests to the DHCP server correctly. To do so go to Wireless->General and dropdown between "2.4Ghz" and "5Ghz", ensuring they have different SSIDs so that your devices will target one of the two explicitly.
If I find any other important info I'll add it. Enjoy!
Note 1: If you enable "Tools->Other Settings->Enable advanced (per IP) monitoring" it will disable hardware acceleration. While you most likely won't notice this unless you've got an internet connection approaching 100Mbit, be aware that you may loose some performance for that functionality.
Note 2: Check out "USB Application-> 3G/4G"... very interesting stuff.
Note 3: I'm investigating an issue that results in WiFi being unable to communicate with the LAN ports. It manifests itself in the log as: Jan 11 17:05:23 kernel: eth1: received packet with  own address as source address . I'll post updates on this later.
Update 2/2/2013: Merlin posted a new beta build. Discussion, Changelog .
Update 2/23/2013: More new builds & bugs fixed! Release Thread and changelog.
Update 3/16/2013: Another new build! Release Thread, Changelog
Update 3/29/2013: Eric just uploaded a new beta build based on a beta release from Asus. A couple exciting changes here including new wireless driver and tools. Note that you'll need to re-add you WoL clients (if you had any) because Asus added a new WoL tool. Also, note this warning from Eric:
"New wireless driver.
This new driver brings quite a few improvements
over the older one.
Note that if you experience any issue with this new
driver, it is strongly recommended to revert back to factory defaults,
and re-configuring your router.
There are a few low-level changes, and
some new default values that you won't pick up until you revert back to
factory defaults."  Release Thread, Changelog, Download
Update 4/4/2013: It looks like some folks are having issues on the new build with the 5Ghz radio. There is quite a lively discussion going on and Eric has answered quite a few questions.
Update 7/6/2013: A new build has been released that introduces support for the RT-AC56U! Release Thread, Changelog, Download
Update 7/24/2013: Another new build, (3.0.0.4.372.31) this time fixing the AI Cloud security issue and introducing the Yandex DNS filtering service. Be wary though that Yandex is in Russia, so if you use this feature (off by default) it may noticeably slow internet browsing since it redirects all your DNS queries. Release Thread, Changelog, Download.
Update 10/3/2013: Eric has been hard at work on a new
build(3.0.0.4.374.33) based on a new source that includes fixes to
general performance, parental controls, and more. Note this warning from
Merlin:
"IMPORTANT:
Due to the SDK change on the RT-N66U, you *MUST* revert back to factory
default and manually reconfigure your router if coming from an older
firmware!
The only exception is if you were previously running either
the Pixie Dust release (3.0.0.4.374.32-sdk6), or a previous beta of
3.0.0.4.374.33 (except for the -sdk5 Beta, of course).
Asus also recommends doing the same for the other models, however feel
free to try without doing so.
It might work fine for most people, but
be prepared to do a factory default reset + reconfiguration if you run
into any odd issues.
And by "manually reconfigure", I really mean it.
Reloading saved
settings would totally nullify the action of resetting to factory
defaults, since you will just end back to where you started, with all
the same (possibly invalid) settings."
Release Thread, Changelog, Download.
Update 12/14/2013: New build! (3.0.0.4.374.35_4) GPL 374.339 (Time machine support for some models), Asus' OpenVPN implementation. (Note this is a total overhaul), Namecheap DDNS, and more.  Release Thread(With Changelog), Download.
Update 1/22/2014: New build! (3.0.0.4.374.38) GPL 374.2078, major driver/SDK changes. RT-N16 is not supported by this build. This is SDK6 only. In short, if you have issues with this build, particularily with wi-fi performance, fall back to an earlier build. That said, the feedback in the forum regarding this build has been great thus far. Note: in most situations, Eric does recommend resetting to factory defaults & manually re-configuring. Release Thread With Changelog, Download
Update 2/16/2014: New build, out for a bit. (3.0.0.4.374.39) Dumps SDK5 and adds a new parental control option to use DNS services to block category based URLs as well as bug fixes. Release Thread, Changelog, Download
Update 3/16/2014: New build: 374.40. Not stable for the RT-AC68U but fixes the RT-N16. DNSFilter enhanced along with IPv6 fixes. This build should also address the highly publicized security issues from last month, but I would still recommend highly against enabling FTP, "Cloud AI", or any other outward facing services on principal. Release Thread, Changelog, Download.
Update 6/6/2014: New build: 374.43. Another new release from Eric today, mostly bugfixes. One feature added; the ability to force a DDNS refresh after a configurable number of days. Release Thread, Changelog, Download. Also, SmallNetBuilder forum member "000111" (7?) had the great idea to start a donation thread for Eric. If you appreciate his efforts it's worth considering heading over to this thread and throwing him a few bucks for the effort.
Update 11/7/2014: New build: 376.48_1. Merge with Asus code 3.0.0.4.376_2769, Samba upgraded to 3.6.24, Miniupnpd to 1.9, Dropbear to 2014.66, OpenSSL 1.0.0o, SNMP enhanced, RT-AC68P support. Release Thread, Changelog ,Download. Also, Eric (Merlin) warns of a but that causes wifi issues. Quoting him: "Note: Previous firmwares (both Asuswrt-Merlin and stock Asus) suffered from a bug where some nvram settings might end up being corrupted, which can lead to the loss of the 2.4 or 5 GHz settings on the webui with newer firmwares. To fix the issue, either do a factory default reset, or run the following commands over SSH:Code:nvram set wl0_band=2nvram set wl1_band=1nvram commitThe actual bug was fixed both on my end and by Asus a few releases ago, however the corrupted setting will cause issues starting with newer firmware versions if not corrected."
Update 8/292015: There have been several new builds, the last of which was great, but this update is to address how to perform source based routing with Merlin/Busybox:
In my case I've got two different internet connections and I want to selectively route different machines through different internet gateways. To accomplish routing traffic based on the source, we'll use the ip rule and ip route commands.  First, make the rule:
ip rule add from [IP]/[CIDR] table [NAME]
where [IP] is the from addr or range, [CIDR] is the applicable CIDR bitmask, and [NAME] is a unique integer to call the route, i.e.
ip rule add from 10.0.0.1.22/32 table 10
then the custom route:
ip route add default via [Gateway IP] table [NAME] dev [ADAPTER]
where [Gateway IP] is the IP of the desired gateway, [NAME] is the same integer as referenced above, and [ADAPTER] is the NIC to which the rule applies, i.e.
ip route add default via 10.0.0.254 table 10 dev eth0
You can re-use the route for multiple rules if desired. To make these rules persistent you'll need to use user scripts.I use services-start with a 10 second sleep in the beginning. Have fun!

Thanks thehin, but I'm not the author of the firmware, just this blog post about the router. :) The firmware author is Eric Suvageau and his homepage can be found here. I'm thankful that he has taken this on since that default firmware leaves a bit to be desired.Thanks for reading!

Hey scottylomez!I'm by no means a bittorrent guru, but hopefully I can get you pointed in the right direction. You won't find this option in the GUI but it looks like the package the router uses is called Transmission. The config file can be manipulated by turning on SSH access ("Administration"->"Enable SSH"->"Yes"... make sure "Allow SSH access from WAN" is off!) and then connecting with your favorite terminal client (Putty, etc) using the same login you use for the web interface. The main conf file can be found @ /tmp/mnt/(sdb1)/asusware/etc/dm2_transmission.conf where (sdb1) is what your drive is mounted as. You can find that by looking @ the entry in the system log when you plug it in. For guidance on how to configure the transmission client, look here and here. Good luck!

Wow - thanks Toby - might be a bit out of my depth but will have a go later.If I break the transmission config file, will I only break the .'Download Master' application , meaning a reinstall will fix any damage?

@scottylomez Yup, you can always "Uninstall" and then "Install" again from the GUI and it will re-extract the contents from the firmware. Alternatively, you can backup the config file before you start by just doing something like cp dm2_transmission.conf dm2_transmission.conf.orig . The firmware won't touch your custom file.

Hey Toby, Great job on the writeup!Having just bought a AC66U I would love to flash tomato on it! although not very tech savvy...I have read that tomato isn't currently supported by the AC66U, does this writeup definitely work with it?Josh

Hi Josh, thanks!This software is the actual firmware made by Asus with some very welcome changes made by Eric Savageau. It works so well with the original hardware that you can use the built in Asus flash utility to go back and forth or upgrade. I'm sure you'll find it quite easy to use. Good luck & have fun!

@toby interesting read.
Does this Merlin firmware allow of url traffic monitoring? so one can easily see what sites are visited and then deciding if they should be blocked our not?
May 9, 2013 at 1:17 AM
Toby Meyer
said...
Hey there, Unfortunately the default firmware does not allow for URL monitoring and the Merlin firmware hasn't added it in. The closest thing is URL filtering which is included, and that can be found @ Advanced-> Firewall-> URL Filter. That filter allows for individual words anywhere in the URL, i.e. "uglypuppies" would block http://host.theuglypuppieshouse.com as well as http://uglypuppies.net. If you really needed the functionality remember that this firmware uses busybox so you could in theory add one of the many URL monitoring packages available for that manually. Hopefully that addresses your question; thanks for reading!

Still issues with parental control on 3.0.0.4.270. Will set alright but will not close down access to the internet at the set time. If anyone is on the internet, access is still possible so of no use. Is there a fix?

Does anyone know if you can get notification when someone connects to the wireless side of the router?
I would like know if someone gets on my network.

Hi @psychosunshine; Great question... I haven't tried this yet but one could install IW on optware and then use a script to monitor and report on clients. Here are some links to get started: Init optwareGet IWIW monitoring script Otherwise you could try scraping sysinfo (used for the default Tools page) but I don't think that has all the information you would be looking for.

said...
Hey @beeker!Good observation; I was able to recreate your issue. Any new connections are blocked, but existing connections (I.E. Netflix, etc)remain open. It looks as if the parental controls use IPTables forwarding rules with the TIME module. Here's an example: Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)target
prot opt source
destination
PControls
all
--
0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0
TIME from 1:0 on Sun MAC 40:25:XX:XX:XX:XX DROP
all
--
0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0
MAC 40:25:C2:3E:D9:1C ACCEPT
all
--
0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0
state RELATED,ESTABLISHED Chain PControls (8 references)target
prot opt source
destination
DROP
all
--
0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0
state INVALID ACCEPT
all
--
0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0
This has do do with the way IPTables evaluates connections. I tried adding an explicit MAC filter via a cron job and that didn't do the trick either; have you considered scheduling a reboot job to correspond with the time that the access is turned off? That would obviously kill all sessions. Another option would be to try installing tcpkill as optware and cron that.

I just bought the RT-AC66U and I have a slight problem. I set up the router the way it shows in the manual but I can't seem to move past that step. The WAN and LAN lights are solid blue and stable, but the Power light flashes very slowly. When I go into "Network & Sharing Center" there's an "!" between the PC and "Unknown Network" and an "X" between the "Unknown Network" and Internet.I also tried the "192.168.1.1" address, but it comes up as not working.I did notice one strange thing: my PC's ethernet port emitted a green light with my last router, but with this one, its red & green O.oI keep hearing how great and easy to setup this router is, but I'm failing at this setup pretty hard. Any and all help is appreciated.

I have read everything here and the Merlin website but I don't really see anything about the probem I am having with the AC66U I have. Bought it back in March to replace a Linksys router (network seemed sluggish and erratic).
Just last week I suddenly noticed that the wireless computers were being identified but I could not connect to them whereas the wireless computers could access every LAN computer. It gets better.
The wireless computers can't access each other.
The only reason I finally noticed this is that my one wireless computer runs my music system and I listen on other computers.
I have a lot duplicated on the LAN system but not everything, so I finally noticed that I was missing songs when I changed settings on my media player (JRiver) and noticed that there were no files from that computer.I don't recall if there was a connectivity problem from the very beginning.I am on the latest ASUS beta build and am ready to try the lastest Merlin beta; but before I do any suggestions?I have checked all the settings and I have it rather basic.
Nothing fancy because I'm not good at networking.There was the comment about wireless not communicating with LAN and I'm not sure if that would be related.Thanks.

Hi @Bob, Boy that's tough to help on that one; there are so many variables there that I can't help much without seeing it. I can say that you probably don't have anything to worry about with the extra light on your PC; I'm guessing your old router had 100Mbit switch ports while the new Asus router has 1Gbit. Your now faster LAN connection is most likely displayed by your PC with that extra light over the NIC. As for the other issue, all I can say with the limited information is to double check the connections and ensure your internet service is working directly on the device from your service provider. Nice nickname btw. :)

Hi there Romas, Unfortunately I have not been able to re-produce your issue. I did a test between a few machines and devices on my WiFi network without issue. Here are some things to check:-Ensure you're using the standard wireless and not guest wireless for your devices. -Make sure your device is set to AP only on the Wireless->Bridge page-(unlikely) make sure there isn't a huge amount of interference in your environment. This is very unlikely to cause what you're reporting but if you're in a high density location it may be worth doing a quick verification. - Make sure you don't have any odd static routes set that would render wireless clients unable to see each other. (LAN->Route, by default empty)When troubleshooting, make sure you use IP addresses (IPCONFIG on windows hosts) to take name lookup out of the loop. Good luck!

Thanks Toby,
Checked those settings.
No issues there.
This weekend I will do a reset on the router and see if that cures it all.
Will let you know if that works.

Found the problem. I have Kaspersky on all my computers and apparently with the last update (which was within the last month) it changed the settings to public network on the wireless computers.
changed it to a local network and now everything works as it should.Way too many settings to go through on Kaspersky.
(and I am also on Win8).

Excellent, I'm glad you found the problem. Thanks for following up Romas; good to know that Kaspersky does that by default now.

Do you know if there is a way to use OpenDNS only on a Guest network?
July 1, 2013 at 7:42 PM
Toby Meyer
said...
Hey @vh57, Great question. I think this may be possible by using a custom dnsmasq.conf file, but I haven't tried it yet. To give it a shot, create the custom dnsmasq.conf file as outlined in Merllin's readme. In short, you would change the settings to what you want out of the GUI, copy /tmp/etc/dnsmasq.conf to /jffs/configs/ . You would then need to change the DHCP scopes to be interface specific. Since the router expects a certain range it will be easiest to take the DHCP range setup by the GUI and split it into the number of subnets you want based on the number of guest networks enabled. For example, if you have a guest network on the 2.4ghz range and one on the 5ghz range then you would need to add two to each of the other standard interfaces you want to serve up DHCP on. Count the total interfaces and divide the DHCP scope up accordingly. After determining this, edit you custom dnsmasq.conf file (under the jffs... dir) to have scopes per their interface. The guest network interfaces are as follows: 2.4Ghz: wl0.x where x= the number representing the guest network from 1 to 3, I.E. wl0.1 for the first guest network. 5Ghz: wl1.x where x= the number representing the guest network from 1 to 3, I.E. wl1.1 for the first guest network. For an example of how to setup multiple scopes in DNSMASQ, see this link. Essentially you will change the DHCP scope options to have the interface as a prefix to the argument, I.E.:dhcp-option=wl0.1,6,208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220You'll need to specify all the other options for each, and you'll need to specify a scope for each interface including the "standard" interfaces as well. Using this, you can specify what options (including DNS servers) you want on each scope. Once you're done, save the file and restart the router. You should now get the DNS servers and other DHCP options associated with the scope served on that interface. There may be some other entware/optware options to accomplish the same by running multiple DHCP servers bound to specific interfaces, but I think this would be worth a try before going down that route. If you get a chance let us know if it works and if you have any additional questions feel free to ask!

Dear toby - I have a question - I know you're not official support but I love this site and learned alot from your post!I just got an N66u after an old WRT54GL with tomato :-) I'm loving it mostly, and 5ghz on my laptop is amazing!The problem is that I have a real "dead zone" for mobile devices, in the same place that it a) previously worked with the outdated WRT54GL and b) works with laptops on 2.4Ghz (not to mention 5ghZ).This is on an iphone 5 AND a newish android device, so i don't think its the mobile hardware thats slow.Do you have any recommendations on what I should do with the settings? I'm running pretty much vanilla asus firmware (updated to latest), but would be happy to install custom FW if you think that'd help. thanks again very much for any help and insight toby!!James

Hi James! Thanks for posting. Making this sort of determination can be a bit difficult there are so many possible causes of interference. Here's where I'd start: 1> Adjust antennas to get the best signal in that spot using something like inSSIDer to determine signal strength. (it's kinda fun to use anyhow :) )
2> Force devices to use the 2.4 Ghz range by disabling or changing the SSID on the 5Ghz range. Since 2.4 was working for you previously perhaps there is something interfering with the 5Ghz spectrum. 3>You could try upping the transmit power (I know the Merlin FW can do it) but I doubt that will help much. For why, see this.4>Try changing the channel bandwidth from "auto", "20/40", "20/40/80"(5Ghz) to "20". Channel bonding can exacerbate reception issues when the signal strength is low.
Hopefully one of those points helps you re-mediate the issue. Good luck!

Hi Toby, great work, and a great read. I was wondering if there is a 'simple' (insert chuckle) way to make my rtac66u have user/ip/mac connection limits, and/or bandwidth limits over wifi? even daily/weekly/monthly data qouta's being assigned per mac address would be really cool to!Thanks in advance if you have any idea's, or can point me in the right direction.

Hey Dave, thanks for the kind words! You could do connection limits on a per IP (or block of IPs) basis using the connlimit module, which is installed with the IPtables build on the Asus devices. If, for example, you wanted to limit everyone on the 192.168.1 subnet to a total of 500 HTTP connections, you could use the command: iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 500 -j REJECTWhere -A is append, FORWARD is the forwarding chain (think of it like the router chain), -s 192.168.1.0/24 is the source IP range, -dport 80 is the port, -m connlimit is the connlimit module, --connlimit-above 500 is the number of concurrent sessions, and -j REJECT is the action to be taken ouside that range. This could be targeted to an individual IP as well; if you wanted to limit to WiFi only you may be able to use -i eth1 instead of -s IPADDR to limit based on input interface rather than IP. Keep in mind that due to the way connections are maintained you'll have to play with the values to get the desired effort. You can see connections being tracked on the System Log->Active Connections page. To add this rule to your IPTables every boot, you will need to use a shell script. You can find more information about setting up scripts here and here. In short, you'll need to format the JFFS partition, create the scripts directory, create a firewall-start script. As Eric points out in his readme, make sure you chmod a+rx /jffs/scripts/* after adding to mark it as executable, and make sure the script starts with #!/bin/sh.On fully fledged Linux installs, you can use the quota module to create a limit on a per host/service basis but it's not installed on the Asus platform. (cat /proc/net/ip_tables_matches) Connbytes is there which may facilitate something close to what you're looking for so you may want to look into that module.
Feel free to post any other questions or findings you have. Good luck!

HiI'm a professional working in network design and came across your page when trying to find if a feature existed on the RT-AC66U.Do you know if I can policy route or more accurately send particular IPs/hosts down a VPN tunnel and others to natively route straight out the internet connection?I live in Singapore and want to have a VPN tunnel to the UK (Any provider like StrongVPN for example) from the RT-AC66U.However I will only have this app on my TV and do not want ALL traffic to go down the tunnel ... hence the question.Do you know if this is possible on the ASUS firmware?Excellent page and contentRyan

Thanks Toby, that's some great leads :) Looks like I will have to get my ssh on, been awhile ;)Actually I only need it against specific ip's, as I'm using dhcp by MAC address. The issue is, well.... Kids. As good as the wireless on a rtac66u is, it is a shared resource, just like a old hub, as opposed to switch.
I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, just explaining my reasons really. To many wireless devices, and kids that want to stream or otherwise download flat out. I need to restrict their given ip addresses to less connections, less bandwidth, and assign quotas so they can't exceed my providers quota. Then everyone can access fairly well, and without ending up throttled to dial up speeds!Thanks again, I will check out your suggestions! :)

Hey Toby:Fabulous blog and an awesome resource for those of us fortunate enough to be surfing on the Dark Knight with the Merlin firmware. Yesterday, after experiencing some strange problems on my router with an older firmware (where I was not able to access the router interface from any wireless client on the LAN), I decided to reset the router and upgrade to the 3.0.0.4.372.31 FW. It runs *much* better, except I am not able to make any changes to the Administration -> System page, so I can't enable connection to the router from the WAN or any of the other functions on that page. The System page doesn't seem to fully display (the tabbed menu at the top does not appear), and when I press the Apply button, nothing happens. Any ideas? Thanks!

Chris, I'm running that fw also with no issues. Did you reset to factory defaults and either upload your saved settings, or redo from scratch? (After flashing new firmware if course) If that doesn't work I'd reflash it perhaps, an clear Nvram, and try again.

Hey @Downward_Spiral, Great question; this one is a bit tricky. Unfortunately static routes, as I'm sure you know, route by the destination rather than the source, so they're out of the question. Here are a couple ways you could tackle the problem: - Set static routes based on destination after OpenVPN client init. Here is a good conversation along those lines. Essentially this will route all machines on your network over the VPN for specific sites (Netflix, etc.) and route traffic not destined for those sites directly out. - A second routing device: While there are devices made for this specific purpose it may be cheaper depending on what you have on hand to setup a VM as another router that sends all traffic through the VPN. That way, you could use that VM as the VPN client and direct all devices(your TV) that you want VPNed through that box as the default gateway. As another potential solution along the same lines, here's an amazing project that uses a rasperry Pi as the router! (talk about cheap)- You could get at VPN service that is DNS selective like unblock-us or overplay. These work by replacing your standard DNS servers, which you would have to insert into your router configuration. When you request the IP of a service that is generally region blocked like netflix, the service returns an IP address of one of their servers and the creates a session on the fly to dynamically route your access to that site through their servers. Good luck!

@ Dave C, Ahhh, that makes sense. :) In addition you could try using the QoS functionality to limit bandwidth, but as I'm sure you found it doesn't really work on incoming bandwidth. @ Chris, Thanks for the compmliment! I think @Dave C has got your answer. I've only had that happen once and Dave's instructions were exactly what cured it!

said...
Quite right, QoS on this is not very good. I did try using it, but with 20 odd devices, both wireless and wired, all it seemed to do was make everything for everyone one incredibly slow, regardless of priorities given. I have a new issue now, but I think it's a genuine bug rather than a config thing. The parental controls no longer seem to work. If enabled, and a schedule set for a given MAC address, it seems to just block that MAC address at all times, regardless of the schedule. Everything appears fine, it just won't let it out. All reachable on the LAN side, just doesn't want to allow it to reach the net. Quite frustrating! I have mailed Merlin to see if he can shed any light as its only been in the last couple of firmware versions that this started happening. Anyone else use the parental controls and found this issue?

Hi Toby, very nice blog, full of usefull information !I was wondering if you could describe a little bit more the log capabilities of the merlin's firmware ?My idea is to leave the 66U in an apartment, for free wifi to my customers, but according to the law , i have to track ip @, dates, mac @ ... So i want all the log information to be transmitted throught internet for example in order to keep them.Is there any means to do that ?

Hey @Dave! I've heard of some issues with parental controls, but I'm not experiencing your issue. I did write a comment that discussed the workings of the controls on 6/22 directed to beeker... perhaps that info would assist you in your pursuit. @Les gites de Liaven: That sounds like an undertaking, perhaps one for its own article. I'd start here:Setup a USB stick as outlined in the article. You should be able to see it under the /mnt (/tmp/mnt) directory. You'll probably need a big one if you plan on logging that much! Next, change your iptables rules in the forwarding chain to log; for override info see my comment to Dave from 8/15. For how to do IPTables logging, see this and this(tips section). I would take other measures though as well because there of a few issues: for starters note that by default clients won't be isolated from each other and as Dave and I discussed it will be very easy for one client to exhaust network bandwidth. Good luck!

said...
Yeah I emailed Eric and he said he has seen a few reports of the parental controls no longer working, both on his, and the stock firmware but hasn't had a chance to look into it as yet.As for the logging, agreed, use a USB stick as described, rather than the routers ram (default I think) and then perhaps a small script via crontab to make a copy at a given time, email forward or email it etc and then delete the original so it doesn't get overloaded, perhaps daily or weekly?
I'm a bit out of the loop with *nix but should be do-able?

Nice write up, I just have a noob question about why I temporarily disable the DHCP server, don't I need this service to connect to the internet afterwards. If its just a temporary procedure while I make the tweaks, can I unplug the modem or should a disable it in System Preferences > Network.
September 3, 2013 at 1:03 PM

@thepope:I could have worded that part better... I was referring to if you have an internal DHCP server other than the router from your service provider. You'll need to leave that one (the ISP router) on. I've updated the post with more specific instructions. Thanks for reading!

Hi Jasper, Tough to say but generally I would doubt that the router would be to blame. Most games use UDP, so buffer bloat wouldn't be an issue unless it was extreme circumstances. (though I haven't seen buffer bloat on this router) The only way it could be caused locally is by overall bandwidth exhaustion, and in that case there isn't much you can do about it. While some vendors tout "gaming priority"/QoS solutions, those don't really work (including on this router) because cooperation with the QoS tags need be honored by every router along the way. Obviously that would never happen, which is why those solutions aren't effective. Anyhow: I'd start by making sure you're not exhausting your bandwidth in any other way. You can use the traffic manager->Traffic Monitor tool on the router to ensure nothing else is using any bandwidth and then try playing the game again. If you've ensured that there is nothing else sapping your bandwidth inside your network and the problems persist, the issue is either with your PC or your connection. There are all sorts of routes to go from there; connection wise I'd try pingtest.net first; their test emphasizes packet loss & latency, which is what is important in your situation. (rather than bandwidth)Hopefully this helps; good luck!

said...
Jasper, ill just add, whilst not with this particular game, I have been through my fair share of online gaming latency issues, and it's never been really anything to do with my router, but the ISPs routers, between me and a given games server. Can even be your own streets lines (especially if overhead lines). If you're sure that you have done everything right as far as the router is concerned, as in, either using upnp (I prefer not to for security reasons) or have forwarded the correct ports to your machine (or console for that matter) then have a look at your modem first. You should be able to gain some insight from it. If its an Adsl connection for example you might check your sync speed, and line attenuation against your relative line distance to the exchange, and also see that your SNR (signal to noise ratio) is within acceptable limits. ISPs often 'profile' accounts as high as 12SNR but will put it to 6 which will significantly help your latency, if the lines and distance to exchange will cope with it. It is possible to tweak it down to about 4, which is better again but any lower and stability becomes an issue. If you're sure that is all ok, then it's time to suss out what's going on between you and the game server.
September 5, 2013 at 12:55 AM
Dave C
said...
It's not always easy to make ISP's get off their butts to check out what's going on... so you need to arm yourself with some information to get them interested enough.So, you at this point should already know that the router, and modem are ok, so run some tests.Launch the game, and connect to the server, but alt tab back to the desktop once its connected.Run 'cmd' and in the cmd prompt type 'netstat -ano'.This will give you a list of all connections, with the PID's (process identifiers) so you can see what exactly is using ports or connections. Launch task manager (cntrl-alt-del) and make sure 'pid' is checked under the view menu, and 'select columns'.Now you can match the PID of all running programs to what is listed in your command prompt, an therefore know whats using what over the net. So, now you should have identified the IP of the server your game is connected to.Either in the same command prompt, or a new one if you like, type:pathping IP-address-of-gameservergoes-here >> c:\pathping.txt It takes awhile to run... about 5-6mins, but when its finished, the cursor will return to a normal prompt, and if you look in the root of your C: you will find a file called 'pathping.txt'.Open it up and you'll find a traceroute from you to the game server, and then some statistics.What it does is ping each router or server in your path to the destination 100 times each, and lets you know how many are lost for each.More than 3% loss is fairly bad. If you can identify consistent losses from the same servers in the path, and you give this information to your ISP they should be able to do something about it. Either themselves if they own them, or by contacting the relevant ISP that is forwarding your connection for them.They might also get a telstra tech out to run line tests between you and the exchange. Its a bit of a pain in the butt, but i've found its the only way to get through the tier 1 script reading 'techs' that don't really know what they're talking about and get an admin / tech that does ;) Hope this helps.. good luck!
September 5, 2013 at 1:14 AM
Dave C
said...
Whoops! forgot to add, if you see in your pathping stat's, servers that are showing 100% loss, ignore them, they are more than likely firewalls that are deliberately not responding to the ping request. You're looking for ones that do respond, but not consistently.

Is there a way to allow only certain IP addresses through the router?
September 24, 2013 at 1:59 PM
Toby Meyer
said...
Hi J, I'm not sure if you mean in or out, but either way.. yes. You can use IPTables rules to block or allow nearly any connection. For the official documentation, see here. You'll need to follow the instructions (don't forget the part under "Creating Scripts")on setting up user scripts to enable custom IPTables rules. To get you started, here's a rule that would drop all outgoing packets from 192.168.1.10:iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.1.10 -j DROPGood luck!

Hey Toby,Was wondering if you could help me figure this out. I have done just about everything 2.5/5 Ghz both provide transmissions of only 145mbps. Nothing pushes it above. I am currently using the stock firmware.
October 17, 2013 at 6:39 PM
Toby Meyer
said...
Heyya huzzyz; There are a lot of things that could cause a slow transmission rate. Have you tried different devices to see if the rate differs across them? Note that it's not just the router but the client that dictates the effective rate. I'd start by giving this article a read; it's one of my favorites. After that, make sure interference isn't an issue and that your channel widths for either 2.4 or 5 aren't limited on the client device. Note that in most situations, you'll have a better shot at high transfer rates on the 5ghz spectrum.

Hi Toby -- I just purchased an RT-N66U to replace a Linksys wireless router that I'm running in bridge mode. The Linksys has a wired connection to a TP-Link TR-860 router. Do you know how if the RT-N66U can operate in this fashion, and, if so, do you know how I can set it up? I've tried logging into the device using the IP address assigned by the router, but that doesn't work.Thanks!
October 23, 2013 at 8:07 PM
Toby Meyer
said...
Hi @Andreas Siegert, Thanks! I think the easiest way may be to add a NAT rule rather than change the port on the daemon. (That would require using the services-start module with some other mods) To add a NAT rule, you'll need to setup a nat-start script. To do so, follow the instructions to setup scripts. (Make sure you pay attention to the
"creating scripts" section) Before doing that, you'll need to make sure the JFFS partition is enabled as well, which is under the Administration->System heading. Try the following rules: -A 192.168.1.1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 808 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.1:80That is assuming your router is at 192.168.1.1. Change those values accordingly if not. You could also make a reference if you wanted to have multiple internal NAT rules like this:-A PREROUTING -d 192.168.1.1 -j ISERVERThen reference the "ISERVER" in other rules. After making that script, ensure it's in the right place and reboot. I haven't tried this approach, so if you do please let us know back here if it works!Thanks!

Hi @rcxyz, I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do so forgive me if my advice is not applicable. If I understand correctly, your R860 provides access to the internet and you would like to hook your clients through the N66U and then out through the R860.
If that is correct, it should be relatively easy to accomplish; the only issue with your approach is that you need to login to what the N66U considers to be the "internal" interface. Logging into the interface that is pulling a DHCP address from the R860 will not work because the router (N66U) considers that to be external and the web portal is not exposed on that interface. When you first setup the N66U you'll need to manage it using 192.168.1.1. If this conflicts with your current IP schema you'll need to isolate it with a workstation, do initial setup, change its (N66U) IP, then hook it back up to your R860. You would then set your clients to route through whichever device you want by setting their default gateway to the IP of the appropriate device. Make sure you only have one active DHCP server; i.e. if your R860 is handing out addresses turn it off on the N66U. That said, if you want all the firewall features, etc of the N66U then you'll want to turn off the R860 DHCP and make sure all the clients are behind the N66U. Hopefully that helps, feel free to post up if you would like more help!
October 25, 2013 at 10:02 PM

said...
I might add, that I run a bridged setup with a rtac66u, and a netgear cable modem/router/wifi. If your R860 supports bridge mode, put it into that, then connect your n66u and reset it so it goes thru the initial setup. It should pickup and control the other router pretty much purely as a modem from there. If it doesn't support this, you'll have to try it as Toby suggests. If it does, but you run into issues, you'll just have to reset the primary router to get it back. Take note of default addresses for both etc, and if your machine has two LAN ports make use of them and run 1 to each until you get it right ;)

I'm having a reoccurring issue as of late with the router that causes all devices connected to via wireless to lose connectivity. It's as if the WAP reboots itself or turns off is radio signal. This happened tonight specifically where my Lenovo laptop, Macbook Pro, and iPad all dropped wireless connectivity. The modem was fine and live. All lights on the router were also active (as far as I could tell). This also happened before I updated to the most recent firmware (3.0.0.4.374_726). I've done most of your instructions other than the dual SSIDs for 2.4 vs 5ghz which seems obnoxious to have to do (no offense to you at all). Any ideas?

Hi @Ruby!Thanks for Reading; I was having the same problem with this router and I tracked the problem to the iPad hopping back and forth between the channels. While I don't like changing the SSID names between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz, I haven't had the issue since I changed them. I'd recommend giving that a shot and seeing if the problem goes away. Good luck!

I have an RT-N66R on a shelf in the closet. To extend range (particularly to the north and south) I replaced the 3 smaller antennas with 3 much longer 15 db gain antennas.
They came with a short coaxial cord which allowed me to place them 4 feet higher.
My questions are, 1) What does the distance need to be between each antenna; 2) Do they need to be angled 45, 90 and 135 degrees to horizontal; and 3) If I need my best range to be to the north and south of my router's location, should the 3 antenna be positioned in a straight line north/south or east west?

Toby Meyer
said...
Hi @Suncoast Equine!That's a great question, and not an easy one to answer. RF coverage can be nearly a career in and of itself. The direction angle, and placement of your antennas will depend entirely on the specifics of the antennas selected. I like to approach the problem by studying the transmission pattern of the antenna in question (which should be available in the manufacturer docs) and then visualize the pattern when I setup. After that, I confirm coverage with a tool like inSSIDer or similar. There are also some great articles out there to help with the process. One of my favorite sites out there, small net builder, has a few good articles: Choosing an Antenna, Fixing your Wireless Network, and this article that directly addresses many of your concerns.I'm sure with a bit of tweaking you'll have the coverage handled in no time. Have fun!

Hi TobyI really like your articles and upgraded to the latest firmware 374.35_4. I have a internet speed problem and wonder if you can give me some pointers. My noticed my internet speed dropped a day ago and did a speed test using www.speedtest.net with and without RT-AC66U (hard wired to desktop). The ping and download speed without the router are 23ms and >10 MbPS. With the router, the ping and download are 1500ms and 2Mbps. I have reset the router back to factory settings a couple times. The strange thing is that the first speed test was on par right after I reset or reboot the router and the speed tests were bad after. I wonder if you have seen that happen to Asus router before? Thanks.Kevin.

Hi @KevinThanks for the compliment! Re: Your issue, that's a tough one. I have not seen that issue myself so without the ability to reproduce it is very difficult to say what could be wrong. You've already taken the prudent steps of taking it out of the loop and resetting to factory defaults; I'd add the following to try:-Revert to older firmware; (x.x.x.x.x.2x series, reset factory again)-Make sure Jumbo frames are disabled (Advanced->LAN->Switch Control->Enable Jumbo Frame->No)-Toggle HW Accel (Advanced->LAN->Switch Control->Enable HW Accelerator->Change)-Ensure you don't have some odd speed/duplex negotiation issues either to or from your Asus router. Hard-set link speeds and duplex where available. Hopefully one of those helps you out; problems like that one can be tricky. Good luck!

Hi Toby - just found your post.
Great reading.
My problem is this.
I purchased a slightly used RT N66R from a friend in New York.
I live in Wisconsin.
After also just purchasing a new 16GB Apple ipad Air, I found Apps I installed on the iPad, like "Find My ipad" and a Download Speed Test app all think I am located in New York.
I took the iPad to our local library and found using their wi-fi, it correctly located it near the library.
The speed test app also selected a location to ping in Wisconsin.I suspect the router is the cause.
Any ideas?
What can I do to resolve this issue.
I have tried resetting the router by holding in the button for at lease 20 seconds, but this does not change anything after reentering the setup data.
Hope you can help.Carl

I'm wondering if the incorrect NY info is a result of how the iPad pulls location data; assuming you have the wi-fi version of the iPad Air, it's not actually capable of pulling real geo location. Using solely wifi the iPad is only capable of determining your location via crowd-sourced data from devices with a GPS. For example, if you had an iPhone that hooked to your wi-fi, that would send the geo-data to Apple, which Apple would then use to determine your location on your iPad. That would explain why it works at the library but not at your house. More info on this can be found here and here. That said, I'm not sure if the crowd sourcing stores MAC address of the AP or what; if so it is possible that the person you bought it from had connected to the wifi with an Apple device that reported that information, and that would explain why Apple is telling you that your iPad is located where you bought it from. If that's the case, invite a bunch of friends with iPhones over, have them connect to your wi-fi, then open their maps app and determine their location. (this discussed @ Apple here.) After I had a few folks over at my place I'm now identified correctly; previously according to Apple I was located in Siberia. :)Good luck!

Thanks for your explanation Toby.
Yes you are correct my iPod Air is Wi-Fi only.
Over the Christmas holidays I hope to have a few visitors that may have an iPhone and have an opportunity to try your suggestion.
I will check back after trying the iPhone theory and report mysuccess or failure.
I sure thought the used ASUS router was causing the problem because it was retaining location info in some memory chip.
I see it is possible to change the IP address.
Is this a possible solution?

HI, nice write up. I have a question about the router. I have the ac66 version. On my speedtest.net my download speed is about 33mbps on all device. But on my phone which is a galaxy s4 which supports the 5ghz ac the speed would be 33mbps for a day then drops to 14mbps after that then I would have to reboot the router to get it back to where it was. Any help would be greatly appriciated

@Carl: I doubt it; internal IP addresses won't matter as I'm sure Apple wouldn't use that as the key for the geo-data since it wouldn't be unique. I'm guessing your external IP is assigned via DHCP from your ISP so there is no controlling that. If I were a betting man though(good thing I'm not), I would put my piles and piles of gold doubloons on the MAC address of the wi-fi access point being the index. @Keng, Thanks! That is odd. If you reboot your phone (not just standby but a full reboot) does the problem go away?

Keng, I'll take a stab and say I think it has something to do with the logging options, being that they get put in ram by default. File gets larger, and less ram available, its ability to network suffers. I had some similiar issues at one stage. Disable Per IP logging if you don't need it. Make sure hardware acceleration is enabled. You can also stick a cheap thumbstick in, enable your jffs partition, and have it store logs there instead. Alternatively, you could just schedule a reboot of your router in the middle of the night, every night via cron.

I like the Merlin or Stock interface of the RT-AC66U much better than the dated dd-wrt.Is there anyway to limit or stop P2P downloading on this firmware better than dd-wrt?

said...
Hey @Anonymous,That can be difficult, but made much easier if you know the machine you are targeting. If you know the MAC or (preferably) IP of the machine you could create custom firewall and/or QOS rules. Generally speaking though, distinguishing P2P traffic from other type of traffic for all your machines can be very difficult. If it is bittorrent you can try the solution outlined here. For more information on custom firewall rules look through the comments in this thread. Good luck!

Hi Toby,I have an odd one for you. So, I bought a Asus EA-N66 adapter to get 5G to any ethernet enabled device around the house, works brilliantly with my ps3. But the issue is, if i use FTP to download from my ps3 to my pc, over 5g, I can get about 10mb/s, but upload to it, and its about 3mb/s. Any idea's for why its so slow the other way? I can't seem to find the cause..

I tried to upgrade to the latest firmware and had to rollback to the 276 version for the N66U. Experienced 75% reduction in wireless speeds for both 2.4 and 5 frequencies with the newer firmware. Did a complete reset before upgrading, still no luck. The only thing that restored my wireless speeds was reinstalling the 276 firmware. This issue needs to be addressed by ASUS. I have seen some pople report the same issue with the newer AC66U router also.

Hey @Jarda! That may be possible (see the firewall rule discussions in the comments here) but I think it would be less work to put a parental restriction product (i.e. NetNanny) directly on the PC you're trying to control provided you have access to it and can prevent the user from using an administrative account. If you're looking for an exercise in learning IPTables, however, it may be worth the effort. :)

Hey @Dave! Hope you're doing well...I'm thinking that might have to do with your signal strength/connection methodology of your PC vs. PS3. Perhaps in this case your PS3 has a better connection; when it is the sender it is responsible for much more data than the other end, but when you switch roles the weakness of the PC connection could be causing the issue. If you look @ your System Log->Wireless log you should be able to get connection type and strength stats; hopefully that will help you get to the bottom of it...

Hi Toby,Good idea. Actually my PC is connected to the rtac66u via ethernet, so its just the router to the ean66. I had a look, on first connection it showed 405rx/450tx (that's not a typo), on 5ghz band. After a little bit, it dropped to 6/6.So i ftp'd into it, and it picked up to 6rx/450tx. Download from it, back to my pc and it holds 450tx, but when sending the other way, if i keep refreshing the wireless log, it shows its rx rate switching between 450 and 6 every few seconds... Maybe it is an RMA of the ean66.

Hey @Dave! interesting... one last thing to check: if you set the

Hi Toby,Nope, did try that. Made no real difference, except making it a bit slower, for obvious reasons, on the low end of the scale.All good, have been advised by Asus to RA it after some discussion. It shouldn't be switching like that.Thanks for your help though :)

Hey Toby! I have a Lacie d2 NAS connected via ethernet to the AC66U. It seems to work fine for awhile but then loses connection to the router. Is this the router or the NAS? I don't do any port forwarding. I keep it rather simple otherwise.The NAS serves as my time machine backup and some torrent use. But I also turn off the 'torrent machine' when not in use to avoid unwanted traffic.The router was originally rebooting on its own every 12 hours or so. Then I cloned the MAC address and it appears (at the moment) to be stable. But the NAS issue still persists during its uptime.

Hi @Unknown!Sounds like you're following good best practices though I'm a bit confused about the 12 hour reboot/MAC address clone need; that may indicate that you had a low level firmware misconfiguration or even a hardware problem. If you have the time, it may be worthwhile to try a full settings reset as Eric outlines here. Beyond that, I'd point at the LaCie device, but that's only a hunch based on having seen other connectivity issues running similar devices connected to Linux. As a last resort, it may be worth a try to see if scheduling a daily reboot when it won't bother you to see if it helps the situation. You can find instructions on doing that here. Good luck!

Hey @Dao, By default on the Merlin (and I believe the Asus standard) you should be able to access the management page from WiFi as well as wired. There is, however, a way to limit access to specific IPs under the administration->system page. Perhaps you have some IPs listed there?

Hello Brandon,I think your issue may be that you are using the stock ASUS firmware, rather than the "merlin" version, which has extra goodies, such as (maybe) the choice of logging destination. The stock firmware zip from ASUS is called FW_RT_N66U_30043745517.zip. The latest Merlin version (as of this comment)is called RT-N66U_3.0.0.4_374.42_0.zip.
BTW, the memory stick I stuck in (FAT formatted) doesn't automount. I had to ssh in and do it by hand.Hank

Thanks @Hank (Saturated), excellent observation! Hopefully that will get you going @Brandon. While the stock Asus firmware has come a long way, it is still missing some of the functionality that the Merlin build has. I recently switched back and forth and I still recommend the Merlin build. Note that since Eric has based it off of Asus' released source, generally speaking it differs only in the added functionality and bug fixes. Thanks!

Not sure what seems to be the problem but I can't get the merlin parental control to work with dns filtering. Only global filter works for me. I enabled the dns filter set the global filtering mode to none and added all the clients to filter with Norton Family; It does not work. If I change global filter mode to Norton Fmaily all the clients are filtered but if I set to none then individual clients are not being filtered. Any ideas what am I doing wrong? Searched around on https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki and smallnetbuilderbut couldn't find a basic tutorial to point out if anything is wrong.

Hi @tallncool!Unfortunately I don't have much experience with the new DNS filtering; I recently had to roll back to an older build to avoid and issue specific to my setup. If you exhaust all options in setting up the new firmware and DNS filtering is one of your primary goals, you could consider rolling back to a build pre-.39; I have tested the old Yandex service and that works fine. That said, I know folks using the new one successfully, so perhaps try switching from Norton to Yandex or OpenDNS to see if the behavior changes? @Tobee (nice name :)) Try making sure your 5Ghz radio and your 2.4 Ghz radio have a different SSID name. I had this same issue with Apple devices and found it was because they were bouncing between the two different spectrums, causing issues with DHCP. By naming them differently (SSID, SSID-5Ghz) it ensured that the devices stuck to one or the other and my problems went away. Hopefully that fixes the problem for you. Good luck!

Hello, I just recently picked up the RT-N66R, and I have been having issues getting two xbox ones to be able to join the same game. Ive narrowed it down to it being an issue with the NAT type. Before this router I never had any issues being able to join the other xbox's games. I tried turning the UPnP off and just porting but no luck there. Any ideas to why I would be running into this issue with the new router?
July 5, 2014 at 9:41 PM
Toby Meyer
said...
Hi Jonathan!Have you had luck using multiple XBoxes before with the same game? This problem is common because some Xbox Live services may want to use a specific port; since you only have one IP address there is only one of that specific port to attach to. When two boxes attempt to play through the same public IP they often have problems since only one can be forwarded at a time. (generally the UPnP or NAT rules have a 1->1 relationship) There are some routers out there that use some tricks with UPnP to attempt to solve this problem (to varying degrees of success) but unfortunately this may not be one of them. A lot of games don't need a specific port and work fine, but it looks like you have run into a case where one does. The XBox Live site has a bit of guidance on this here. Either way, in your case the only hope to have it work at all would be UPnP due to the dynamic nature of the need. You could play around with one Xbox in the DMZ to see if the rules handle the UPnP requests differently, but that's a long-shot.

Hi Toby, I have been trying to find a solution for my odd problem - would appreciate any ideas. I have the Asus rt-n66u and it was functioning well for over 6 months, but now 2.4 Ghz is a joke (5Ghz perfect). I have updated to the latest asus firmware (3.0.0.4.376_1071). The internet provider gives me 20Mbps - always perfect and good on 5Ghz. 2.4 GHz- constant fluctuation, slow, ranging from 1Mbps to 3Mbps, occasionally achieving 20. Sometimes it just completely drops, no internet. Pinging the router gives me spikes of 1 to 150 ms. Going crazy, searched the net, checked different channels etc, no success. Any ideas, recommendations? Would truly appreciate :-).

Hi @redfox, It sounds like that may be spectrum interference, and not necessarily from a competing WiFi AP. The 2.4ghz range is popular for all sorts of devices, and perhaps someone setup camp with a cheap cordless phone or something similar. The best way to detect this is by using a site survey tool... unfortunately the best aren't cheap (see this link). You could give cheaper/free apps such as Wifi Analyzer for Android a shot, but most of those apps only look for WiFi based interference rather than anything on the spectrum. Short of the more expensive solutions you could move your equipment around to assess which direction the interference may be coming from. Hopefully that gets you started... good luck!

Thank you, I will keep trying (somehow site survey tools seem a bit out of pocket range :-)) - I did try Android wifi analyzer, but nothing new shows up - no other local wifi networks. What really drives me crazy that its so intermittent - sometimes the 2.4ghz is ok for hours, and then it just looses connection totally - while 5ghz just works. No cordless phone, etc. Will try to test a different router at least to make sure that its not the asus. Thanks anyway.

Hi @Unnamed! If you're comfortable forwarding ports then there is no need for UPnP; as for NAT-Acceleration go ahead and turn it on, including "Level 2" if your firmware revision supports it.

I'm certainly not a network/router settings guru. I have a basic understanding. I have the RT-AC66U for about two years... since it first came out. Been working great. I did have to reboot every now and then, and found that my network speed would improve when I did. In the last week or so, none of my devices can see the 5 ghz network. I have multiple devices (iPads, iPhones, the newest MacBook Pro, Apple TV, DirecTV streaming between TV's, etc ...). Had no problemes with any of those devices. I do connect to Internet fine, on the 2.4 ghz network. My SSID's are different w/different passwords. Just out of the blue, the 5 ghz disappeared. My MBP does have AC connectivity. When I login to the router, everything looks normal on the 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz. I just can't see it on my devices. I have rebooted, reset router to no avail. The router is supposed to be able to handle up to 5 different networks I believe, but I don't see where I can setup another network to test or setup another 5 ghz network. I did upgrade to the new OS X (Yosemite a few weeks ago). Everything was fine. But a few days after that upgrade, and after rebooting the router, is when the 5 ghz network disappeared. Any suggestions? Thanks!!

Hi @Chuck!That's odd; you're right... it shouldn't happen. Here's what I'd try, in order, checking for success after each step: 1> Take screencaps of your desired settings and then reset to factory settings using "Administration->Restore/Save/Upload Setting". After reboot re-set your settings as desired. Don't use the "save" or "restore" settings because that may re-create the problem. Check to see if that took care of it. 2> If not, revert to an old version of the firmware, reset settings, (see step #1)and check again. 3> "Fix" the router with a hammer until all networks disappear. I'd advise flashing to stock firmware and utilizing factory warranty replacement before doing #3, but it's up to you. :) Good luck and feel free to post your progress if you like.

Hey Toby, any ideas on the best way to go about logging all joins and disconnects from WiFi?I'm not even sure if disconnects generate log messages. When someone moves away from a wireless network, at which point does the router become aware that a client is no longer there without actually doing some time of ping to it.My goal is to see if I can log when people come and go.

Hi Toby, thanks for the article and helpful links.I am fairly new to wireless configuration so I apologize in advance. I have a PS4 and HTPC w/ Win8 64bit downstairs with N capabilities and both are connected wirelessly using the RT-NC66R. They are both getting less than 8mbps, while both mine and my wife's iPhone are getting 100mbps+. My wired desktop is also getting 100mbps+. I tried a few solutions with the PS4 such as manually changing the DNS and IP but no luck. I haven't followed all the instructions listed on this page yet in fear of time and messing something up. I haven't enabled port forwarding or assigning a static IP either. Before I begin the lengthy process, do you have any ideas on what I should be checking? Firmware is up to date as well. Thank you

said...
Hey @JoeyIt's possible that both your PS4 and your PC are connecting via the 2.4Ghz spectrum, while your iPhones are connecting via the 5Ghz spectrum. Since interference on the 2.4Ghz is much more common it could be limiting your rate.To test this, change your 2.4Ghz SSID broadcast to a different name by going to "General->Network Map(default login page)->System Status->2.4Ghz" and changing the SSID to something different, then clicking apply. This will force any clients using 2.4Ghz to re-prompt for the new SSID. If after that your iPhones connect without prompting but your PS4 or PC has trouble connecting then that could be it. If so, then your PC and PS4 may be impacted by being on a more crowded frequency range. While the PS4 doesn't support the 5Ghz range, your PC might. You can attempt to do so by examining the wireless NIC settings. As for the PS4 you will have to wire it, reduce interference on the 2.4Ghz range, or move the PS4 and the wi-fi closer each other. Give it a shot and post results if you like; good luck!

Hey Toby, that was it. They are connecting to the 2.4ghz instead of 5ghz. My iPhones kept connecting to the same SSID (5ghz band) and got fast speeds, while my PS4 connecting to the new SSID was getting much slower speeds, same with the HTPC. You're right, they both prompted for the new SSID as well. I guess I will find a way to wire my PS4 and HTPC. They are pretty far from the wireless modem (I would guess 60-70 feet then enclosed in a media cabinet). Thanks for your help sir!

Hello Toby!I've faced a problem for a very long time now and would appreciate help. I've tried everything. The thing is that I have two router, one asus rt n66u and a sluggish one with an IP-telephony port which I need but I want my internet connection to come from the asus. I've connected the asus to the modem and then the sluggish router to the asus (from lan to wan) and set the asus as access point. This is the only way I've found that both internet and telephony works, and I've tried every possible combination.
The thing is that I can't connect to the asus with all of my devices through wifi. Some succefully connect and some get stuck on "getting IP-adress". Some that connected at one time might randomly get disconnected at another time and the other way around. I've gotten into my router settings and noticed that 127 clients were connected to the AP. Is that the problem? But how do 127 clients connect when I'm living in a normal house with few neighbors? And I do have a password. I would very much appreciate if you could help me with this annoying problem.Thank youKristian

said...
Hey @AnkeT: Tough to tell; there are so many factors at play there. I will say though that FTP is not the best protocol to use for movie streaming; since it relies on TCP, your bandwidth is constrained by the fact that measures are taken to assure each packet arrives in order and perfectly. In the event that a packet is missed it is then re-transmitted, interrupting the stream. Better movie streaming protocols would rely on UDP, which is similar but doesn't care if packets are dropped. This is a much better choice in latency sensitive real-time applications like video streaming or VoIP calls. If you have a machine on at home all the time you could consider using something like Plex, which not only relies on UDP to stream
but can also transcode movies in real time to take less bandwidth if needed. @KristianQuite a bit there as well, but here are a few things to check: 1> If you're not protecting your WiFi with a password I highly recommend doing so; having an open access point could open you to legal issues should someone decide to use it for nefarious purposes. 2> Assuming your sluggish router and the Asus are on the same subnet you want to ensure that only one DHCP server is active. By default the Asus has its on and it should work fine in most scenarios, so you'll want to make sure that the DHCP server functionality is turned off on your sluggish router. The steps will vary depending on the router, but generally it will be referred to as "DHCP Server", "IP Pool", or something similar. You will need to make sure that is turned off. If you confirmed your sluggish router does have a DHCP server but you can't turn it off, you may need to try doing so on the Asus as that is possible. Only one device on your network can be handing out IPs or you may see problems like you're experiencing. 3> That # of clients is huge. To get more details on who is connected review the "System Log" page and check the "Wireless Log" (for wireless clients), "DHCP Leases", and "Connections" pages. Note that connections will have quite a few since many may be listed for one host. If you have clients connected that you don't recognize you should definitely take measures (password, etc) to ensure you aren't sharing your connection with unwelcome visitors. 4> The only other thing I can think of based on what you mentioned is to ensure your 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz radios have a different SSID, especially if you have any IOS (Apple) devices. Some IOS devices will connect and disconnect rapidly if the two radio spectrums have the same name. To do so you can change the name of one of the SSIDs from the home page. Hopefully that helps, if not post back with a bit more information and we'll get you working!

said...
Thank you for your answer Toby!I have a pretty difficult password so I'm sure that the 128 (one more today so 127 doesn't seem to be a limit which I initially thought)
clients aren't using my connection. I guess that they only detect it? The SSIDs are different for the different frequencies and I don't own any Apple products. The problem must be the DHCP server. I'm not that in to router tweaking and such but I can't seem to find the option to turn the DHCP off on neither the router or the AP. I noticed that when I turned the Asus into AP-mode I got fewer settings to adjust, might be that I lost the option when I turned into AP? My sluggish router is an Inteno 150g I think. Some of my devices are able to connect to the wifi of the Inteno and some are connected to the Asus. However I still can't connect all of my devices to the Asus. The IP of the sluggish router is the normal 192.168.1.1. But the Asus's IP-adress is quite weird (178.174.162.62). Don't know if that made anything clearer. Is there another way to turn the DHCP off? Thanks in advance Kristian

Hey there @Kristian!Tough to tell what could be going on, but I do suspect something may be strange with your overall network setup; it sounds like you may have two (or maybe three) class c address spaces in your network, and depending on your devices that could be what is causing the issues and the client connection count. As an experiment you could try using the slow router connected directly to the WAN router and the Asus connected to that in AP mode only. That should simplify the IP addressing scheme and you can see if the # of clients and disconnects go down even though the router isn't optimal; at least that would identify your problem. Note too that the Asus should be able to pass SIP trafic; I'm not sure if your IP Telephony hookup is a SIP endpoint, but if so you can enable NAT passthrough under WAN->NAT Passthrough->SIP Passthrough & see if that helps you get rid of the slow router overall. @Trevor: Sorry, I can't help with that issue; I'm using Plex for my media server. If I were you though I would try looking at the system log for system log->general log.

Hi, I am getting the warning message 'maximum number of concurrent DNS queries reached (max 150). We have about 15 devices all connecting by wifi and my internet provider says either someones laptop must have a virus as overloading modem with requests or too many people have too many applications open at the same time.
Is there a way to increase limit to more than 150, or how do i determine what the actual problem is as the internet speed keeps dropping.

@Paul, That's pretty tough to tell without more information; there are quite a few variables at play. The first thing I would check is the connection log ("System Log"->"Connections"->"Refresh") and look for IP addresses in the "NATed address" category with excessive connections. If any are far and away above their peers, then investigate that machine. Assuming you have Excel you can view the data easier by copying it and saving it to a text file, then importing it to sort by IP.

My merchant card processor just started requiring us to use compliance program from TransArmor. I failed their scan. It says encrypted communication channel on port 23. It says to transition to using more secure alternatives such as SSH instead of Telnet and SFTP in favor of FTP.If I install that Merlin firmware can I switch to ssh somehow? I don't see where to change it with the present factory firmware.

Hey @Jeff!Yah, on the Administration->System page you can enable/disable telnet (default on), SSH, require https, and most of the other settings you'll need to be concerned about.

Hi Toby,I have a lot of interest reading your exposed knowledge and I hope you will be able to help with the following need.I used to have a pfSense router on a fanless device that got fried recently.I have tried both dd-wrt and tomatousb on my RT-AC66U. with dd-wrt, as soon as I enabled the dnsmasq option, I immediately lost all internet access.The most interesting feature for me with pfSense was the DNS Forwarder service. I need that!I host multiple domains in some internal servers and it was a snap to set up on pfSense:domain1.com -> 192.168.1.50domain2.com -> 192.168.1.51etc...Then I could access these domains from the outside seemlessly.Can Merlin Asus firmware do that? How?Thanks a lot for you great articles.

Tried the merlin, enabled ssh and I still failed my compliance scan. Anymore tweaking is beyond me so I bought a dlink router and it passed!asus going on craigslist or ebay!

@marcnzYup! Merlin includes dnsmasq; you have to enable and use jffs to store config changes. Eric has done an excellent job of writing up documentation regarding the custom config files here. DNSMasq info can be found here. I'm not entirely sure of your use case, but hopefully this is what you're looking for. @Jeff Hah! I can't fault you there, though I can't say I'd recommend consumer grade routers for commercial applications; most of them use common soft(firm)ware components that aren't vetted for security. Assuming you're not using wi-fi I would disable it as well. That said I know small businesses may not be in a position to not only buy, but support high end equipment, so keep those scans going and make sure to update the firmware.

Yes Larry, the Asuswrt-Merlin firmware 378.54_2 runs just fine on the Asus RT-AC66U. As I have been using Merlin for almost two years just upgraded to this newer version and all is well.Dave

Nice write up and the comments are even more helpful.
I stumbled across this because I bought an RT-AC66U and while some devices (my laptop and some of the Androids) are working well, I found that one tablet (Android) and an iPhone have frequent disconnects.Checked this AM and noted that my SSIDs for both 2.4 and 5 are the same so I think when I get back home I will be changing one to see if that fixes the problem. I may go back through and do some of the recommended tweaking.

Hi Toby,Thanks for this whole walk through. Now I have an odd one here. I've got an RT-AC66U with the latest Merlin firmware. It's setup as an AP behind my actual ISP router. I host a website on a server internally and I am unable to reach this via the Asus on DNS name. On IP it's not a problem. The website is reachable from my ISP router and externally too. Any ideas here?

I would guess that your isP's router is using your isp's DNS servers, which are unable to resolve private addresses. You could either have the router itself manage DNS, or your own server do it, or use a dynamic DNS / vhost with a port forward. If your IP is not static this may be worth looking into. Just an idea....

Hey @Yeroentje!As usual, Dave C is correct(thanks Dave!). You'll either need to setup an internal DNS server to resolve your server's hostname, or if you have only one system it would be easier to update your HOSTS file with the IP of your web server. Depending on your OS, you'll need to modify: %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows)/etc/hosts (Mac OSX, Linux) %SYSTEMROOT% is usually c:\windows for a win based system. In either OS case there should be samples in files that exist there. These files (by default) have default precedence over DNS servers or local name resolution. As an alternative, you could swap the order of your routers. Personally I use a couple different ISP routers (multiple connections) in front of the Asus router. This would allow for the use of DNSMASQ with the Asus router should you choose to do so.

Hello,here's my problem. I have an RT-AC66U, firmware 3.0.0.4.378_9313 (latest at this moment).Plugging my computer directly into the ONT, I get ~800Mbps download and ~600Mbps upload. However, when I plug the router in, the upload stays roughly the same (goes down to something like ~500Mbps), while the download speed caps at ~210-220 Mbps.I looked at all settings, discussed with the ISP for hours, I'm a bit stuck.Any idea what's going on with the router? Just broken?Thanks!

HiI have a motorola surfboard modem.
I have an RT-N66U.
I have the latest merlin firmware.
Here is my problem.
When I download torrents straight from my surfboard through ethernet, I get a solid steady 6.25 mega byte download.
My Cox package max 50/5...is right at 6.25 megabytes so this is working perfectly.
When I hook up the RT-N66U through either 5 or 2.4 channel the download wildly fluctuates.
About second to second it goes like....6.2, 5.2, 6.3, 4.8, 6.6, 6.8, 4.8, 5.1, 5.8....something like that.
I also noticed (and am 90% sure these two are related) the router CPU load fluctuates between 100% and 50%...second to second like a roller coaster when im looking at GUI system status while downloading.
Is it supposed to be like that?
I feel like I am missing something.Thanks!

Hi,Is there a way to null route an ipv6 network in Asuswrt-Merlin?
Netflix blocks my ipv6 tunnel because it can't geo-locate it, so I'd like to force Netflix to fail over to ipv4 from my network, but leave ipv6 enabled for everything else.Thanks!

If anybody cares, thanks to the NANOG mailing list I found the way to null route an ipv6 network, which fixed Netflix for me:ip6tables -I FORWARD -d 2406:da00:ff00::/48 -j REJECT

D-Link, DNS-323, DNS-343Cannot FTP back to your DNS-323? Directory listing fail on the Pure-FTPd? Need to do passive (pasv) ftp on the Pure-FTPd on the DNS-323/DNS-343?I face some problems while trying to ftp to my DNS-323/DNS-343 behind the router. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. I normally have problem when I am trying to ftp from a location that is behind NAT as well.Wrote up a shell script for starting the Pure-FTPd correctly on DNS-323 and DNS-343. It is meant for fonz’s fun_plug 0.5 and firmware on the DNS-323 should be greater than 1.04. Just edit the necessary settings and Pure-FTPd will start as a chroot daemon.The shell script will detect you WAN IP and pass in as a parameter to start the daemon.Download the file: pure-ftpd.shContent of the file

Does it work if both parties are behind NAT? I think it is better to set it to chroot (-A) if you wish to lock each user to their home directories.Try using this or edit to your likings.

I am suspecting in V1.02 for DNS-343, one of the updates “FTP server now supports TLS/SSH” is giving me problem.Apparently it works in DNS-343 V1.01. But in V1.02, it keeps having the “Response: 530 Login authentication failed” error when I configured via pure-ftpd. However, when I enabled the ftp service in the webui, at least my username and password is verified and accepted.As you said, I configured my username and password in webui and added it to the ftp access rights.

So it shouldn’t be much of a problem. Hope it helps.RyanDecember 24, 2008 at 5:18 pmPermalinkLooks like periodically we have to re-start the ftp server in order for it to bind to the correct external IP. This is because of external IP is dynamic IP.Like if I restart the ftp server now, it might bound to IP 116.15.169.64. Few days later the IP might change to another IP (decided by the ISP DHCP server) while the ftp server still bound to this old IP hence the client will not be able to connect to it.Is there anyway we can
automate this refresh?Thanks for the info and guide.,.shadowandyDecember 24, 2008 at 6:04 pmPermalinkRyan,You might wish to crontab the starting and stopping of the ftp daemon at certain time intervals. As mentioned earlier, most ftp clients nowadays would know that the reported IP (by the server) is wrong and it would automatically use the IP it is connected to as the host to connect for the PASV connections.DaSFebruary 6, 2009 at 11:24 amPermalinki got this error msgCould not retrieve directory listing I won’t open a connection to 192.168.2.5 (only to 222.164.182.2)i forward ports 20032 – 20039 and 21 on my routerany other issues to take not of or to re-edit the Pure-FTPD file??GujuMarch 8, 2009 at 7:38 amPermalinkHow do u execute this script? jst put in fun_plug directory?shadowandyPost authorMarch 8, 2009 at 3:36 pmPermalinkGuju,You can put it in /ffp/start .

February 23, 2013April 26, 2016Recovering ASUS router firmware without Windows
If you own an ASUS router and you brick it while trying to upgrade the firmware or some other action, you'll probably find documentation saying you need to run a Windows-only firmware restoration program to undo this damage.
While this is apparently the only officially supported method for restoring firmware (the alternative being to ship the router to ASUS for repair, a 10+ day process), I found with some exploring that the Windows program is likely just a glorified tftp client, and that you can restore firmware using some more standard, non-Windows tools.
I'm listing below the steps I had to use today after trying to upgrade my RT-AC66U device from firmware version 3.0.0.4.266 to 3.0.0.4.270.  (The release notes for the latter indicate a fix for a "live update related bug" which is what I suspect I encountered when I first tried to do the upgrade via the web GUI.)
I'm a Mac user, but these steps should work for other non-Windows operating systems such as Linux. It hopefully goes without saying that you should follow these steps at your own risk, and I make no claims or warranty about the outcome; you could end up worse off than you are now.  You could set your router on fire. You could end up killing another version of yourself living in an alternate universe.  Be careful.
1. Make sure your router is indeed in need of an emergency recovery firmware restore.  On the ASUS unit I have, this is indicated by a slowly flashing power light and a clear lack of Internet connectivity.  Make sure the other usual methods - power off, hold down the reset button, hold down the reset button as you power on, etc. - don't fix things.
2. Find a way to get a known good ASUS firmware image file onto your system.  This is probably a file that ends in ".trx" such as "RT-AC66U_3.0.0.4_270.trx".
3. Unplug all other network devices from the unit, and connect your Mac or other system to the ASUS unit with an Ethernet cable plugged in to port #1 on the router.
4. Setup your network configuration so that you have a static IP address on the 192.168.1.0/24 network block.  I used 192.168.1.10 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 and a gateway of 192.168.1.0.
5. Open a Terminal window and make sure you can ping 192.168.1.1., the probably IP address of the ASUS router.  If you can't ping the router, the rest of these steps probably won't work.
6. CD into the directory where the firmware image ending in .trx exists (see step #2 above).
7. Run these commands from the terminal prompt, using the correct firmware image filename in the "put" command:
$ tftp
tftp> connect
(to) 192.168.1.1
tftp> binary
tftp> put RT-AC66U_3.0.0.4_266.trx
Sent 22765568 bytes in 76.5 seconds
tftp> quit
8. Give the router about 5 minutes to process the firmware image you've just sent it.  I had to then manually turn the unit off and back on to get it to reboot into a working state.  Once it came back up, I could again ping it and I could again access the admin GUI via the web.
If that doesn't work, it wouldn't hurt to repeat the steps again and give it another try.  If that still doesn't work, you'll probably want to call ASUS for an RMA case (that's 812-282-2787 in the US and Canada).
I would have hoped that a company manufacturing devices for the modern age would not hobble their customers` ability to self-troubleshoot by limiting the recovery process to only users running Windows.  Even if the above method is unsupported, they could at least publish it in some form so that they don't use up their time and their customers` time with unnecessary interactions with Windows users, or worse, mailing units in for repair that could instead be repaired where they sit.
I hope these steps are helpful to someone else.  Let me know if you find other techniques that might help in similar situations. (If this post really got you out of a jam and you're feeling super thankful, consider donating Bitcoins.)

Thanks very much for this short tutorial.
Unfortunatley in then end I could not even ping the router, so I had to get an RMA and send it back.
They still make the best routers but need to improve on how firmware gets updated.

If you can't ping the router, then you could try using ARP to give you an IP address associated with the MAC of the device.
http://www.intel.com/support/netport/pro/sb/cs-015307.htm
Might not work with something like a router that already has an IP address.
Or else use wireshark to listen for any traffic at all over the wire to glean the IP address range. If you don't know it already.
If neither work, and you can't RMA, then there's always the possibility of using a BusPirate to write to the eeprom that the device is likely using. That depends on you getting access to a good firmware image somehow. Whether it's processing a downloaded file or copying from a known good device.

I had the same issue, and these instructions worked brilliantly, with one caveat: Even in rescue mode, my router used the same IP it had before it bricked, so I had to use that instead of 192.168.1.1.

You might need to type:
tftp> timeout XXX
Where XXX is the number of seconds before the upload times out. My default setting was 30, which wasn't long enough. 120 should be sufficient.

I also had to set my timeout to 120.
Actual time was 90 seconds. Also, if people can't ping their router, make sure it's not being blocked by a firewall; this was a stumbling block for me.

Thanks very, very much!
After spending too many time around my wife's WpC with no success, I've finaly managed to fix my Asus RT-N11 router with my Fedora 18!
My router was blinking fast the power led, and didn't appear to respond to reset!
It happened that it had it's IP was on 192.168.123.254!
1- Configured my ethernet to 192.168.123.222 with 255.255.255.0
2- Managed to ping the router in 192.168.123.254
3- Performed the command you did
4- Waited for about 5 minutes
5- Restarted the router
6- Performed a reset
7- Et voila! Access the web GUI in 192.168.1.1 with DHCP!!!

Nice usefull comments on this site. Did not help me though. After the cable company did some upgrades, my router became unresponsive. No IP-address and power light slowly flashing.
Connected it with a dedicated cat5e cable to the computer and listened to it using wireshark to see what the router was doing.
This turned out that is was doing nothing. Normally you can pickout an ipaddress this way but no luck. The only thing coming from the router was spanning tree requests.
???
Connected the internet port of the router to an other ac66u router's normal routing port. The lights started flashing and it came up with an ipaddress 192.168.2.1.
Connected with a browser to the router and set it up again.
Something strange though. I re-setted this device in all the ways I could find on the internet, also the 30-30-30 method. It did not work. When finally I could get in to the router, everything was still there. User, passwd and wireless information ... strange.

Second, if the router subnet was changed (I changed mine from the default .1.1 to .0.1)...that's the same subnet you'll use for the procedure.

Thank you SO MUCH for this! This also worked flawlessly to flash the Shibby mod of TomatoUSB to my RT-N12/D1. Seeing as how all this is, is a tftp connection it seems rather silly that ASUS doesn't have a tool ready for all platforms.
For more info on TomatoUSB and Shibby's mod check out tomato.groov.pl. I really much prefer Tomato to ASUS's stock firmware.

Chris,
This was a perfect solution and worked exactly as advertised!
My ASUS RT-AC66R froze after a short power interruption and nothing i could do could get it restarted.
Luckily I came across your posting just before I was going to ship it back.
Thanks for not ignoring we Mac users!

This article is exactly what I've been looking for, however when I type the commands into terminal. Nothing seems to happen?
Do you type them one at a time? Do you get a response after typing each one?
When I type the first line, I get
-bash: $: command not found
when I type
tftp> connect
I get a cursor but no other response?
Any help appreciated

Simon,
You don't have the tftp program. You should get that first.
The tftp> part is the prompt from when you have that program open. At that prompt you type connect, rather than typing in "tftp> connect" to the bash prompt.

Hi,
I have the same problem but do not understand your reply James. Maybe because of my English or little clue about Terminal. How can I get tfpt program that runs in Terminal? 😮
Thanks a lot.
I may have bigger problem that my router has different ip since ping gaves me only timeout.

Thanks for the tutorial my friend! However, whenever I try to connect with my Asus WL500W I do get a connection via TFTP, but it drops after ~30s/1m. This in turn makes it quite hard to PUT the datafile, if I can hardly get it to binary mode. Let alone the possibility it might brick my router if the file doesn't get through.
Using Debian 7.2 wheezy running Linux kernel 3.2.0.4-amd64. Connected with my router through cat5e. No wifi, ofc.
After pulling power and replugging it, it boots in normal mode, without problems.
Goal: replace DD-WRT for Oleg's FW.
Any help is appreciated.

Great post and thanks!
I'm able to get to get a response when I ping the router, but then when I go in to TFTP the file, I kept getting timeouts.
So, I set the timeout to "6000" just to give it plenty of time, but no luck.
It just sits there.
It's been close to 10 minutes now and I'm not getting the "sent...." response.
Any ideas?

Just a spot of thanks for this. My router broke mid-update and was not responding to anything. Couldnt ping it @ 192.168.1.1 but thought I'd give your TFTP instructions anyway and the router came back with all its settings intact. Worked for both stock and also the alternative firmware I use.
Thanks a lot for posting !

Wow! It worked for me thanks! But with one modification. It failed first so I've installed Wireshark. And checked that it doing ARP requests for 192.168.1.11. So I've changed my IP from 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.11 and it worked. Thanks again!

Chris,
You are a genius.
I had spent many hours over a three day period trying to bring my Asus router back from the dead.
I could not accomplish this with the Asus router utility and Windows computers.
I had given the router up for lost.
But I followed your instructions and the router is back to life.
I bricked it in the first place trying to upgrade the tomato firmware on it.
I don't know if I have the courage to try again.
You really made my day!

Using your instructions I have successfully restored my "dead" Asus RT-N to its newest version of Asus firmware.
I would like to flash the router to Tomato firmware.
Could I just follow the same tftp instructions and substitute a tomato firmware compatible with my router into the tftp instructions and accomplish the flash that way?
I've seen some tutorials that basically seem to do that in a Windows environment.
I am running Mac OS X.
Thanks.

Had a mishap with my upgrade yesterday and ofc I don't own a windows pc anymore...
Tried your howto and everything seemed to work fine....but... when i rebooted the router it went back to recovery mode with the power light slowly flashing...
Still being able to ping the router i ran the process again, but still the same. When I try to reach the web interface it just gives me a sign which says (roughly translated)
"Settings have been updated, the website will update. Changes has been made on IP-adress or port. You will now be disconnected from RT-N66U. To access the settings of RT-N66U, reconnect the wifi and use the updated IP-adress or port."
Any idea about the updated ip-adress or port...? tried several different ip-adresses but none work except 192.168.1.1 and gives me the message above.
Thanks for a good howto anyway!

I initially received the same webpage message as you.
I followed the instructions again and, this time, waited a good 15 minutes before I rebooted.
This seemed to do the trick as the router rebooted normally and I could access the router GUI.
Give it a shot and best of luck!

By the way... This tftp method works great to install the TomatoUSB firmware.
I had to reset the NVRAM (power off, hold WPS button, power on, wait 30 seconds, release WPS button) and let the router reboot a couple of times.
After that 5GHz was disabled.
I needed to go into Tomato's Web Interface, reset NVRAM from there, and then reboot again (without changing any settings).
Now it is all good.

Hey there, awesome guide! Can you please help with the network config part in Ubuntu? I drop eth0, then restart it with: (my router is .29.1)
ifconfig eth0 192.168.29.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
route add default gw 192.168.29.0
Then when I run the tftp commands it just times out on put, even with 8 minute timeout. I can ping 192.168.29.1 and get a response, though. Thanks!

Worked like a dream on my RT-N66U after Asus's automatic update via the web browser borked the box.
(OSX 10.10.4)
Had to force it into recovery mode with a 5 second reset push, but after that your tftp insight was straightforward to execute.
And my settings remained intact too, which I wasn't expecting. It rebooted from net 1 into my regular LAN subnet and all was well.
Thanks!

Your post saved my night.
Accidentally flashed my rt-ac68u to dd-wrt instead of latest Asus flash by grabbing wrong file.
renaming to trx to bin didn't work, ASUS recovery tool did nothing.
I ended up installing TFTP in Windows (features and such under programs) and using that tool to upload the trx following your instructions.
Worked like a charm. (forgot my lan adapter at the office for my macbook)

Just saved me £80, thank you so much! I would just like to add, if you find the router is returning to recovery mode every time, wait at least 20 minutes after completing the push command before restarting the router. Before you turn the router back on, hold the wps button then turn it on and keep the wps button held in for 30 seconds.

I tried resetting the router maaaany times and noticed my cable connection was active just a minute or so, when pinging the router, before losing the connection to the router.
Once the ping was OK I started
a tftp software I found (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html) which worked like a charm (I couldn't get the installed tftp work in terminal mode).
Spent 4-5 hours on this and your instruction made it work in the end!

I don't know when this became available, but Asus now has a firmware restoration app available on the Mac App Store:
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asus-firmware-restoration/id1020519014?mt=12
I tried following the instructions from this post, and it didn't work for me. However, the Asus Firmware Restoration app worked fine, and I used it to upgrade my router to asuswrt-merlin (the built-in firmware upgrade interface also failed when I tried to go to asuswrt-merlin).

after i spooned my asus a couple of months ago, i found this page and some advice on the SBN forums.. the problem was caused by the tomato router firmware i tried uploading didn't work and it didnt reboot
or come back correctly and the reset didnt work because i think the tomato web updater messed up
Being a unix geek, i used the tftp commands because you can see clearly what's going on..
1. I did an NVRAM clear first by using the WPS button and power on, this worked. (fast blinking power light)
powered off
2. I did a reset button and power on, and firmware upload, slow flashing power light.
you have to power on the router.. do a ping from your machine to 192.168.1.1 - wait until you get a reply. then
3. did the tftp, completed on asus firmware.
psyfer:Downloads danilo$ tftp
tftp> connect 192.168.1.1
tftp> binary
tftp> put RT-AC68U_3.0.0.4_380_3831-g93dfe8c.trx
Sent 40280064 bytes in 34.9 seconds
tftp>
then wait... wait 5 minutes +
-
then reboot.
it worked
a treat.

On RT-AC51U the guide applies on the tftp part. But for some reason on two of my
routers ALWAYS tried to send TFTP -acknowledgements to a pre-defined IP address 192.168.1.75 so I had to set my computer to have this address. I managed to accidentally discover this with wireshark and there was no mention of it in any manual.
Also small side note was that I could not use the tftp -client on linux with the -c -parameter as for some reason when the "put" was done, the router reset itself without flashing the new firmware.

My experience comes from RT-AC66U
There is broadcom web UI accessible in rescue mode, it allows reset the nvram (solution for most of the firmware upgrade problems) just reset restart and have your router back.
It also allows to upload new firmware. The trick is to remember what was the previous LAN configuration and browse to the previous router address once you entered the rescue mode.
Rescue mode might not enter following the instruction provided, I recommend to disconnect power hold the reset button for 10 sec and connect the power back.

On the ASUS unit I have, this is indicated by a slowly flashing power light and a clear lack of Internet connectivity.
Make sure the other usual methods - power off, hold down the reset button, hold down the reset button as you power on.

Man thanks for this, I knew there had to be a specific protocol it was using, either ftp or tftp, and you confirmed my suspicions.
I just didn't know if the windows utility ran any other cmds to make it install the firmware.
I noticed the LED had stopped blinking after 5 minutes so I believed that meant the the firmware was done installing so maybe that can be something to check for as well.

Thanks! This is helpful even for windows users. Instructions helped me find and access the IP of the router (reset to ..1.1). At that point I could pull up a CFE miniweb server page on the router at that IP with an upload option I used that to upload the firmware file. One tip, upload as soon as you can get the miniweb server page to render after rebooting the router. That seemed to work when not doing that resulted in a page the eventually timed out. You'll get a success page if the file uploads successfully. FYI

Changelog 380.xx
Asuswrt-Merlin Changelog
========================
380.70 (8-Apr-2018)
- NOTE: This will be the final 380.xx release for
all models.
The RT-N66U and RT-AC66U
support will be dropped, and all other
models have been migrated to the new gen
branch, as of release 384.4.
People who wish to keep getting updates for
these two older models should look at the
john9527 fork: https://bit.ly/2EV5Oat
- CHANGED: Tightened security around some config files.
- CHANGED: Samba protocol support can now be set to
SMBv1, SMBv2, or SMBv1 + SMBv2 (the new default).
This will result in a performance drop on all
models, but will be more secure.
Ideally, people should change it to SMBv2 only,
and then reboot all their client devices to start
using only the new protocol.
If performance is more important than security to
you, then you can switch it back to SMBv1, which is
the old default behaviour.
- CHANGED: Switched to the new Entware repo for armv7 models.
To upgrade, run the following commands TWICE:
opkg update; opkg upgrade
- FIXED: Apply button not working on the OpenVPN
Client page.
- FIXED: Potential racing condition that could lead to two
instances of miniupnpd running at boot time.
- FIXED: Broken FAQ links (backport from 380_8120)
- FIXED: Security issue in httpd (CVE-2018-8879).
- FIXED: Security issues in httpd (backports from 380_8228)
380.69_2 (28-Jan-2018)
- NOTE: The official IRC channel has moved to
Freenode (#asuswrt).
- CHANGED: Quantenna watchdog is less likely now to
incorrectly assume the QTN CPU has crashed
(which can lead to router reboots). (RT-AC87U)
- FIXED: IE11 field validation issues on OpenVPN and
DHCP pages.
- FIXED: Router crash when importing an OpenVPN certificate
longer than 3499 characters (the supported limit)
- FIXED: Users were allowed to enter invalid characters on
some of the OpenVPN client page fields.
- FIXED: CVE-2018-5999 in httpd (backport from 384_10007)
- FIXED: CVE-2018-5721 in httpd (Merlin & theMIROn)
380.69 (11-Dec-2017)
- NEW: Added option to disable the Asus NAT tunnel service under
Other Settings -> Tweak.
Not quite sure what this
partly closed source service is for, but it eats a
fair amount of CPU and RAM (backport from 382)
- CHANGED: Updated odhcp6c to be in sync with upstream
(patch by theMIRon)
- CHANGED: Updated libogg to 1.3.3 and libvorbis to 1.3.5.

and CVE-2017-12150 (backported to Samba 3.6 and 3.5)
- FIXED: Httpd crash when accessing certain webui pages with
no connected Ethernet clients
- FIXED: DNSFILTER rules would have priority over OPENVPN Client
rules (when client has DNS set to Exclusive mode).
- FIXED: traffic routing from the router itself would fail when
restarting the firewall while using an ovpn client with
policy rules in effect.
380.68_4 (4-Oct-2017)
- CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to 2.78 (contains a number of
security fixes).

380.66 (12-May-2017)
- NEW: Merged with GPL 380_7378
Notable changes:
* Port forwards can select a specific source IP
* Security fixes for CVE-2017-5891, CVE-2017-5892
and CVE-2017-6547
Note:
* If you are experiencing new wifi stability
issues, try disabling Airtime Fairness on
the Wireless -> Professional page (on all
bands).
- NEW: Option to disable Wanduck's constant DNS probing
for WAN state (Tools -> Other Settings)
- NEW: Allow disabling the use of DH, by entering
"none" in the DH field for OpenVPN server config.
- NEW: Added new Internet redirection mode to OpenVPN clients
called "Policy Rule (Strict)".
The difference from the
existing "Policy Rule" mode is that in strict mode,
only rules that specifically target the tunnel's
interface will be used.
This ensures that you don't
leak traffic through global or other tunnel routes,
however it also means any static route you might have
defined at the WAN level will not be copied either.
- CHANGED: Ovpn importer now recognizes the "port" and
"reneg-sec" parameters.

- CHANGED: Better feedback provided when an ovpn file upload
generates a problem due to a key/cert that's
not provided inline.
Inform the user which of
these he will need to manually provide.
- CHANGED: Disable bridge multicast_snooping, as this should be
unnecessary, and it could interfere with EMF, UPNP and
other multicast applications.
Can be re-enabled from
the Tools -> Other Settings page.
- REMOVED: The Virtual Server page no longer allows users to
edit existing port forwards (our existing code is
incompatible with Asus's newer webui code and will
need to be re-implemented.)
- FIXED: WOL page fails to load if adding a client with a
quote in its name.
- FIXED: Couldn't add a DHCP reservation client if its name
contained a quote.
- FIXED: New outbound connections weren't logged if firewall
logging was enabled.
- FIXED: OpenVPN server didn't always work properly in udp mode
when in a dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environment (backport
from GPL 382_9736)
- FIXED: When disabling NCP support in OpenVPN, the router
could still be trying to use it if the remote end
had it enabled.

incorrect GMAC state checks (Asus bug) (patch
by john9527)
- FIXED: Some models would sometime randomly fail to start one
of their wifi radio, possibly due to a hardware design
issue.
Partly revert the 380.65 changes that removed
the automatic reboot if one radio was disabled at boot
time, but reduced the maximum number of reboots to 1.
380.65_2 (10-Mar-2017)
- FIXED: CVE-2017-6549 (implemented temporary workaround,
until a proper fix from Asus)
- FIXED: CVE-2017-6548 (backport from GPL 7266)
- FIXED: WOL page fails to load if adding a client with a
quote in its name.
- FIXED: Couldn't add a DHCP reservation client if its name
contained a quote.
380.65 (3-Feb-2017)
- NEW: Merged with parts of Asus GPL 380_4180, left out
most of it because of too many bugs in it.
- NEW: Upgraded to OpenVPN 2.4.0, and implemented support
for many of its new features:

- NEW: New firmware availability notification.
The router will
notify you if a new firmware is available, and will also
let you view the changelog before sending you to the
download page (the update process remains manual).
Note that the automated check will only report new
final releases.

- CHANGED: Improved webui performance, by caching large static
Javascript files such as jquery, and increased cache
life from 5 mins to 1 hour.
- CHANGED: No longer include Download Master packages in the
firmware for those models that still included them,
reducing firmware size by a few megabytes.

- FIXED: Only hostname was used as remote server in an exported
OpenVPN client config when using Namecheap DDNS.
- FIXED: Security vulnerability (XSS/CSR) in httpd (backported
fix from 380_4005).
- FIXED: Chrome would try to autofill some fields (such as on the
DDNS configuration page), which could be problematic.
- FIXED: IPTraffic database was no longer properly named after
the router's MAC address on the AC88/AC3100/AC5300.
If you recently enabled it, you will need to either
re-create a new database, or rename the existing
database from tomato_cstats_000000000000.gz to
tomato_cstats_XXXXXXXXXXXX.gz, where "XXXXXXXXXXXX" is
your MAC as found with "nvram get et2macaddr", in
lowercase (AC88/AC3100/AC5300 only).
Regular traffic monitoring (stored in
tomato_rstats_XXXXXXXXXXXX.gz) is fine.
380.61 (4-Aug-2016)
- FIXED: Connected OpenVPN clients reporting as disconnected
on the status page following any wireless config change
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: OpenVPN server would report being "Initializing"
while it already was ready, following any
wireless config change (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Various stability issues with minidlna (reverted some
of Asus's customizations)
380.61 Beta 1 (31-July-2016)
- NEW: Merged with GPL 3831.
- CHANGED: updated dropbear to 2016.74.
- FIXED: Do not enforce b/g mode as "auto" if wireless mode
is also set to Auto.
380.60
There was no non-beta release, due to limited model support
and unsolved WAN stability issues.
380.60 Beta 2 (5-July-2016)
IMPORTANT: The firmware image file format was changed by Asus.
Starting with 380.60, you will no longer be able to
flash versions older than 380.60, or Asus versions
older than 3.0.0.4.380_3000.
You can currently downgrade by using Firmware Recovery
mode, but there's not guarantee that this will keep
working in the future.
- NEW: Merged with GPL 3479.
This includes the new file format
required for certification purposes.
- NEW: Option to enable overhead calculation on Traditional QoS
for DSL users (ARM-only)
- NEW: Option on System page to disable the new forced
redirection to router.asus.com (defaults to disabled)
- CHANGED: Updated OpenVPN to 2.3.11
- CHANGED: Allow to specify IPv6 prefixes up to 126 on the IPv6 config
- CHANGED: Networkmap will now announce itself as "Asuswrt/networkmap"
when connecting to LAN's web services.
- FIXED: OpenVPN server instances weren't properly reporting
if an error occurred at start time.
- FIXED: wget was unable to access https site due to not
having a CA bundle to verify certificates
- FIXED: odhcp6c was sending bogus preferred prefixes, so
anything larger than 64 could result in an invalid
prefix
- FIXED: Language selector is missing on router set for the
JP region (reverted Asus change)
- FIXED: Client names with single quotes couldn't be edited
in the networkmap client popup (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Router wouldn't run SMB to provide browser master
or Wins services if no USB disk was plugged
- FIXED: Router would sometime fail to renew a WAN DHCP lease.
(fix by theMIROn)
380.59 (10-May-2016)
- NEW: Merged with 380_2697 GPL.
This includes beta MU-MIMO support for
the RT-AC87U/AC88U/AC3100/AC5300, and IPTV fixes.
- NEW: Option on OpenVPN client/server page to reset them back to the
factory default settings.
- EXPERIMENTAL: Added support for codel and fq_codel to ARM models
(RT-AC56U and newer).
When enabling Traditional QoS or Bandwidth Limiter,
you can now change from the default sfq queue
discipline to codel or fq_codel.
(based on Kyle Sanderson's Tomato backport)
NOTE: Traditional QoS is currently broken on the
newer models (RT-AC88U and up).
This is a known
issue in recent Asus releases.
- CHANGED: WAN -> NAT Passthrough now allows you to determine whether or
not to load the NAT helper module for h323, rtsp and sip.
Asus's old behaviour is "Enabled + NAT Helper".
- CHANGED: DNSFilter client dropdown now uses Asus's new one integrated
with networkmap.
- CHANGED: minidlna now supports refreshing an existing database, so the
Tweak setting was updated accordingly
- CHANGED: Enable SPNEGO support in Samba
- CHANGED: Integrated Asus's networkmap into the DHCP reservations page
- CHANGED: Updated Tor to 0.2.7.6
- CHANGED: SSH WAN access will also work over IPv6

- CHANGED: Fields on the DHCP static lease page are now sortable
(original patch by Allan Jensen)
- CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.2h
- FIXED: Daily/Monthly traffic monitoring shows invalid values on the
RT-AC88U/3100/5300, even with CTF disabled.
Implemented a
temporary workaround.
- FIXED: WPS wasn't working on the RT-AC3200
- FIXED: Backported security fixes from OpenWRT to Samba 3.6.25,
addressing the following:
CVE-2015-5252, CVE-2015-5370, CVE-2015-5296,
CVE-2015-5299, CVE-2015-7560, CVE-2016-2110,
CVE-2016-2111, CVE-2016-2112, CVE-2016-2115,
CVE-2016-2118.
- FIXED: OpenVPN clients set to policy-based routing and Exclusive
DNS mode were still adding the tunnel nameservers to
dnsmasq, causing both routed and non-routed clients to use
them.
380.58 (20-Mar-2016)
- NEW: Merged with 380_1354 GPL
- NEW: Added Tweaks and Hacks settings to Tools -> Other Settings.
These are UNSUPPORTED tweaks, intended mostly for
experimentation, or very specific situations.
If unsure how
to apply these, manually reboot after changing them.
One of new settings there lets you disable hourly network
rescans, to resolve issues with NAS/printers coming out
of sleep every hour.
- NEW: Added setting to configure OpenVPN's auth digest algo.
- NEW: Added setting to configure OpenVPN's logging verbosity.
Note that this setting is global to all clients/servers.
- CHANGED: Updated OpenVPN to 2.3.10
- CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.2g
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 1.9.20160222
- CHANGED: Updated udpxy to 1.0-build 23-10 (backport from GPL
380_2345)
- CHANGED: if you set an OpenVPN client DNS mode to "Exclusive"
and you enable policy-based routing, then those policies
will also determine which DNS to use (the tunnel's or
the ISP's).
This is based on DNSFilter's technology.
You no longer need to use DNSFilter to control
the DNS used by your OpenVPN clients.
- CHANGED: Made OpenVPN traffic bypass CTF, which resolves
some throughput issues with it
- CHANGED: Disabled X11 Forwarding support in Dropbear,
for security reasons.
- FIXED: PPTP static route handling script was broken
- FIXED: minidlna would check for the wrong database filename
at start time
- FIXED: Wrong status shown for VPN Client 3
- FIXED: OpenVPN clients were run on the wrong CPU cores.
Now, odd instances correctly run on the second core.
- FIXED: Using DNSFilter with default mode set to "router" would
prevent using the router for IPv6 lookups.
- FIXED: Account limit wasn't properly allowing up to 10
clients for SMB/FTP (patch by vit9696)
- FIXED: Having multiple OpenVPN clients configured with
multiple "Accept DNS configuration" modes would
only apply the last client's setting.
Now, we
apply the most restrictive setting of all
configured clients.
- FIXED: RT-AC68U 2.4 GHz was broken if CTF was disabled
(downgraded wifi driver to
6.37.14.105)
- FIXED: Diasbling the SIP NAT helper would also drop all port 5060
traffic.
Some users need to keep the SIP helper disabled
with their SIP client.
Reverted that GPL 858 change.
380.57 (24-Dec-2015)
- NEW: Merged with 380_1031 GPL
- NEW: Added RT-AC3100 and RT-AC5300 support
- NEW: Added RT-AC68U HW Revision C1 support

Can be enabled under LAN -> DHCP.
- NEW: Added custom/postconf support for igmpproxy.conf.
- CHANGED: Increased user account limit from 16 to 32 on
the VPN server pages.
- CHANGED: Updated e2fsprogs to 1.42.13
- CHANGED: Increased maximum entries in Parental Control
(time scheduler) to 32.
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 1.9.20151119.
- CHANGED: Updated Openssl to 1.0.2e.
- CHANGED: Downgraded Dropbear to 2014.66, too many issues in
the newer releases.
- CHANGED: Improvements to VPN Status page
- FIXED: CTF not automatically disabled when enabling IPTraffic.
- FIXED: Openvpn clients 3 through 5 were all run on the first
CPU core.
They are now properly alternated like the
first two (odd on CPU1, even on CPU0)
- FIXED: smb.log generated by networkmap could fill up RAM
- FIXED: upnpc_xml.log generated by miniupnpc could fill up RAM
- FIXED: Inconsistant names used on IPTraffic and Sysinfo page.
Now, we give priority to any description manually entered
on the networkmap, followed by static hostname, then any
current (lease) hostname.
- FIXED: MAC queries sent to the OUI database were broken due to
changes on the IEEE website
- FIXED: Applying changes to OpenVPN client page would start the
client even if it was disabled/stopped.
378.56_2 (2-Nov-2015)
- CHANGED: Reverted the memory buffering optimization
for ARM devices, as people keep panicking
over the lower amount of free RAM.
You can
manually re-enable the optimization by setting
"drop_caches=0" in nvram.
- CHANGED: Allow using a port < 1024 for http(s) webui
interface.
- FIXED: EMF wasn't working on AC56/AC68/AC87.
- FIXED: Couldn't connect to ISPs using VLANs (RT-AC87U)
- FIXED: Editing Port Forward entry with ellipsis in
the description or the port range would
still edit the shortened version instead
of the full content.
- FIXED: Debug log from mDNSNetMonitor could gradually
fill up RAM - disabled it.
- FIXED: Router crash if pasting SSH key > 2047
characters.
- FIXED: Editing an entry on the networkmap would
clear the hostname if entry existed in
the DHCP static list.
- FIXED: OpenVPN server in secret key mode
would fail to start.
- FIXED: Couldn't add entries to the MAC Filter list
of Guest Networks (reverted our previous
implementation which conflicted with
Asus's new one).
- FIXED: NTP failing to refresh for some cases.
Implemented temporary workaround.
- FIXED: Some services not properly starting at
boot time (like Parental Control or Tor)
378.56 (25-Oct-2015)
NOTE: There is no 378.56 build for the RT-N66U at
this time, as Asus hasn't released updated
source code for this model yet, and there are
new closed source binary components that are
necessary for this new release.
Make sure to read the changelog of the two
previous betas for the complete list of
changes since 378.55.
- CHANGED: Nameserver handling is more resilient to
scenarios where dnsmasq fails to start due
to a broken configuration
- FIXED: PPTP/L2TP client page broken on French locale
- FIXED: Entries on the Virtual Server page with ellipsis
in their name or port range weren't properly
copied to the Add fields when edited.
- FIXED: Additional fixes to truncated hostnames related
to networkmap
378.56 Beta 2 (18-Oct-2015)
- CHANGED: Increased Guest MAC filter entries limit to 64.
- CHANGED: DHCP query logging no longer override configured
syslog level, and option was renamed to "Hide queries"
to be more intuitive in regard to the level logging
configured.
- CHANGED: Enabling Hide DHCP queries also silences any RA
routine event.
- CHANGED: Reverted networkmap's printer detection change
as it didn't resolve the printer wakeups.
- CHANGED: Reorganized settings on the System page
- FIXED: QoS page layout in Firefox
- FIXED: curl wasn't using the firmware's CA list (regression)
- FIXED: Models with 128 KB support were only reporting 64 KB
in the nvram userspace tool
- FIXED: Traditional QoS not working when IPv6 is enabled
(patch by charlie2alpha)
- FIXED: Smart Connect page fails to save interface policies
- FIXED: VPNStatus page was broken on French locale

- NEW: Support for Russian ISP Telenet (code by theMIROn)
- NEW: ipset support in dnsmasq (patch by ryzhov_al)
- NEW: default loglevel is now configurable and defaults to
5 (notice) instead of 0 (emergency)
- NEW: local syslogd loglevel is now configurable through the webui.
- NEW: Support for extra-certs in OpenVPN
- NEW: Editable DHCP static leases list, virtual servers, port triggers.
- NEW: IP addresses on the Network Service Filter page can now be
subnets in CIDR format (i.e. 10.0.0.0/24)
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 20150723 snapshot
- CHANGED: Updated openvpn to 2.3.8
- CHANGED: Updated dropbear to 2015.68 + upstream patches
- CHANGED: Updated minidlna to 1.1.5.
- CHANGED: Support up to 5 different OpenVPN clients (to match Asus)
- CHANGED: Maximum openvpn policy rules reduced from 128 to 100, fewer
priority slots wasted in the RPDB tables (could have been a
problem with the increase in the number of supported clients)
- CHANGED: Improvements to VPN Status page
- CHANGED: Connection failure reason shown on the OpenVPN client
configuration page.
- FIXED: Router crash when an invalid or corrupted DH parameter
is used on an OpenVPN server configuration.
- FIXED: 2.4 GHz temperature would be missing on the Sysinfo
page when disabling the 5 GHz radio on the RT-AC3200.
- FIXED: Max tracked connection limit wasn't user-editable
- FIXED: Resource leaks in ez-ipupdate if an update failed
- FIXED: Networked printers coming out of sleep every time
networkmap queried their LPR service
- FIXED: Resource leak in networkmap when scanning for
printer servers
- REMOVED: Regulation mode setting on Wireless -> Professional.
This can't be adjusted anymore, as it was moved to
a closed source component.
378.55 (17-July-2015)
- FIXED: DHCP lease page could get confused by IPv6 clients on
the LAN.
378.55 Beta 2 (11-July-2015)
- CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to 2.73 RC9 (backport from GPL 6975)
- CHANGED: Updated odhcp6c to newer version (backport from GPL 6975)
- CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.2d (fixes CVE-2015-1793, only present
in Beta 1 - 54_2 was not affected)
- CHANGED: Display existing key/certs on the OpenVPN pages once
they've been migrated to JFFS.
- FIXED: Time scheduler-related features (Parental Control & Wifi
scheduler) were broken (backported fix from Asus's GPL 6975)
(beta 1 regression)
- FIXED: QTN firmware was still being copied to RAM rather than rely
on the symlink to flash added in Beta 1, to save 4 MB of RAM.
(AC87U)
- FIXED: Dropbox cloud sync would fail on some setups (backport
from GPL 6975)
- FIXED: Entware-setup script would generate an invalid services-start
script
- FIXED: Duplicate zoneedit entry on the DDNS service list.
378.55 Beta 1 (3-July-2015)
- NEW: Merged with GPL 6117.
Notable changes from Asus:
o New token-based webui authentication (more secure)
o OpenVPN certificates moved to JFFS2, saving nvram.
key/cert fields will show up empty on the webui,
any new key/cert you paste will be written back
to /jffs/openvpn/ .
This means that if you revert
back to a previous version, your key/certs will
no longer be in nvram, so OpenVPN instances will
fail to start.
o New network client list on the network map
o CTF support for PPTP/L2TP WAN (Russian ISPs) (ARM)
- NEW: Reformatted DHCP lease list under System Log.
- NEW: Reformatted Port Forward page under System Log.
- NEW: Reformatted Route Table page under System Log.
- NEW: Reformatted IPv6 Status page under System Log.
- NEW: Display more details about UPNP/NAT-PMP/PCP redirections
on the Port Forward page.
- CHANGED: The JFFS2 partition is now always enabled, as it is
required by various firmware functions.
The options
to format it or to enable/disable user config/scripts
remain configurable.
- CHANGED: Updated OpenVPN to 2.3.7.
- CHANGED: Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.2c.
- CHANGED: Use a pre-generated 2048-bit DH from RFC 3526 instead of
generating our own when doing the first time setup for
OpenVPN servers.
This is necessary as openssl 1.0.2b and
up now reject 512-bit DHs, and generating a 1024-bit
would take far too long on a router.
The end-user still has the possibility of providing his
own - as long it's 1024-bit or stronger.
- CHANGED: Updated minidlna to upstream Git snapshot from 2015-06-26,
and switched to the newer build system.
- CHANGED: Upgraded ffmpeg from 0.6.0 to 0.7.17.
- CHANGED: Accept DHCP lease duration of up to 31 days on the DHCP page
- CHANGED: No longer regularly flush caches from memory on ARM
router.
This will mean a lower amount of free memory is
shown, however that memory gets freed whenever something
actually needs it, so this is normal. (ARM)
- CHANGED: Display the size of cache memory on the Tools -> Sysinfo page
- CHANGED: Improvements to the Networkmap (ability to remove an entry,
removed the alert() from modifying an existing entry)
- CHANGED: Save over 4 MB of RAM on the RT-AC87U by not copying
the QTN firmware to RAM (RT-AC87)
- FIXED: Wireless Log page would fail to load if the SSID
contained certain characters
- FIXED: Wireless Log page would fail to load when in Media Bridge
mode on the RT-AC87U
- FIXED: DDNS page would complain about an empty account field
when setting it to CUSTOM with no prior value in that field.
- FIXED: Automatically generated DH was too weak (512-bit) and
preventing clients based on newer OpenSSL releases from
connecting.
We automatically replace any weak PEM with our
2048-bit one.
- FIXED: minidlna could get stuck building its database (reverted
Asus's recent memory optimizations)
378.54_2 (10-June-2015)
- FIXED: The exported opvn config for clients had the incorrect port
value.
- FIXED: Busybox's zcip was missing a patch from 378_4950, preventing
it from working (and in turn preventing igmpproxy from working
for people with PPPoE connections where their modem does not
provide any DHCP lease to the physical WAN interface)
378.54_1 (8-June-2015)
- Some of the builds were unstable, did a complete recompile of all
releases.
There was no code change.
378.54 (7-June-2015)
IMPORTANT: if you were previously using the AiProtection ad blocker, you
will need to manually disable it over SSH after flashing this
release, by running the following commands:
nvram set wrs_adblock_popup=0
nvram set wrs_adblock_stream=0
nvram commit
- NEW: Merged with Asus GPL 378_5134.
- NEW: OpenVPN policy rules can now be set to route matching traffic
through either the tunnel, or to your ISP (allowing you to
create exceptions to your tunnelling rules)
- NEW: Added OpenVPN server setting to let the OS manage
socket buffers (by inserting rcvbuf 0 and sndbuf 0 in
the server configuration)
- CHANGED: Upgraded OpenSSL to 1.0.2a, adding new tls ciphers
to OpenVPN and the https webui
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 1.9.20150430
- CHANGED: Reverted kernel backport of the parallel printer support,
and reintroduced fix in lprng.
This should hopefully fix
the recent printing breakage issues.
- CHANGED: Removed AiProtection's ad blocker, as it's too buggy to
be usable, breaking numerous mobile applications,
and not being configurable in any way.
- CHANGED: OpenVPN policy routing rules are now applied at boot
time (when WAN comes up), so clients who are blocked while
a tunnel is down will immediately be blocked until
the tunnel comes up.
- CHANGED: Upgraded Quantenna firmware to 378_6065 release (AC87)
- FIXED: Router DNS weren't reverted to their original values
when shutting down an OpenVPN client with "explicit-
exit-notify" enabled.
Now we manually clean it up
after the user manually terminates the client - it might
still not be cleaned up after an unexpected shutdown however.
Ideally, users should try avoiding using this setting when
possible.
- FIXED: Some legitimate VPN packets could get dropped due to their
conntrack state.
Now, only INVALID packets coming from the
WAN interface are dropped.
- FIXED: OpenVPN client would sometime try to connect before the clock had
been set by NTP at boot time, preventing it from connecting.
- FIXED: AiProtection security check would fail to load when Dual WAN is
enabled
- FIXED: Various fields would allow you to enter a single quote character,
which could break the webui.
Now these fields re-validate the
content after you deactivate the text field.
- FIXED: Switching between All Traffic and Policy Mode OpenVPN routing while
the option to block traffic when the tunnel goes down wasn't
properly removing those rules, so a tunnel going down in
All Traffic would still block policed clients.
- FIXED: EMF wasn't working on ARM models (missing userspace tool)
378.53 (26-Apr-2015)
- NEW: Merged with Asus GPL 378_4980 (with pieces from 378_4850 for AC56/AC68
and 378_5183 beta for AC87)
- NEW: OpenVPN policy routing.
You can select client IPs or destination
IPs which you want to route through your VPN tunnel.
You can enter
a single IP (192.168.0.1) or a whole subnet in CIDR format (for
example 74.125.226.112/30).
You can optionally block WAN access to these as well when the
tunnel goes down.
- NEW: Ad blocker based on Trend Micro's Web Reputation System (WRS).
This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature implemented by Asus but that
isn't enabled in the stock firmware.
- CHANGED: Updated Tor to 0.2.5.12
- CHANGED: Those providing a signed SSL certificate for httpd can now
provide chain certificate.
The three PEMs must be in
that order: client, intermediate, CA.
(Patch by sasoiliev)
- CHANGED: The setting to enable the neighbour solication filter rule
for Comcast's request flooding was changed to "ipv6_ns_drop",
and now defaults to "0" as this hack causes issues with
other ISPs.
- CHANGED: Backported dnsmasq patch that reverts a fix for Windows 8
clients as it could cause issues with other clients.
- FIXED: DNSFilter would fail if you had it set to "Router", and didn't
have a DNS IP entered on the WAN page.
- FIXED: MSS clamping wasn't applied to traffic in both direction, moved
it to the mangle table.
- FIXED: OpenVPN client firewall "external" mode does not exist - removed
from the webui.
- FIXED: PPTP account list could become corrupted after removing an entry
on the PPTP server page.
378.52_2 (5-Apr-2015)
- CHANGED: Updated AiCloud prebuilt binaries for MIPS models
- CHANGED: Applied kernel patch for MIPS kernel ported from 376_3861,
related to CTF support
- FIXED: AiCloud would fail to start unless you had HTTPS enabled for
the webui (causing the key/cert to be missing)
- FIXED: DDNS hostname would become corrupted after backing up
your router configuration (Asus bug)
378.52 (3-Apr-2015)
- NEW: Merged with Asus GPL 378_4608
- NEW: Added ECDHE support to the webui (when accessed over HTTPS)
- NEW: The DHCP server can now provide a second DNS to its clients
- NEW: You can tell the router not to advertise itself as a DNS
- NEW: Experimental Tor support (feature originally developed by
Asus, but not available yet on stock firmware).
You can
enable it in the VPN section of the webui.
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 1.9.20150309
- CHANGED: You can no longer disable the JFFS2 partition if
Traffic Analyzer is enabled.
Likewise, you can
no longer enable Traffic Analyzer if the JFFS2
partition is disabled.
- CHANGED: The selected refresh rate of the Wireless Clients
page will be saved to a cookie
- CHANGED: Removed obsolete (non-safe) ciphers such as RC4
from the router's https webui
- CHANGED: Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.0r
- CHANGED: Removed Turbo button support from webui, as that feature
doesn't work with the current bootloader everyone is
using now (RT-AC68)
- CHANGED: Performance optimization to the httpd, dropbear
and rc services
- FIXED: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz-1 clients were swapped on the
Sysinfo page (RT-AC3200 only)
- FIXED: Wifi PSK wasn't blurred until activated (regression
from 378.51)
- FIXED: Samba's custom config/postconf were ignoring the
state of the global option to enable them (they
would always be used)
- FIXED: Samba's custom config/postconf usage wasn't logged
- FIXED: Some services would fail on their first attempt
to start at boot time due to the QTN subsystem
taking too long.
Implemented patch from Asus
which eliminates the long QTN stall at boot
time.
This resolves the issue where some users
had trouble connecting their WAN at boot time (RT-AC87U)
- FIXED: NAT rules could occasionally fail to be applied
(patch by john9527)
- FIXED: The Apply button on the Adaptive Bandwidth page
had a clickable area so wide that it even covered
part of the left side menu.
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: USB menu was removed instead of Parental Control on
DPI-enabled models
- FIXED: QoS page was still available on the AP/RP modes on
DPI-enabled models
- FIXED: Error on OpenVPN Server page if using a DHCP pool for
connected clients.
- FIXED: UPNP would be reported as enabled on the security report
if it was enabled on the secondary WAN even if Dual WAN
itself wasn't enabled.
Now we check that Dual WAN itself
is also enabled before reporting so.
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: mtd-erase was unable to erase the brcmnand partition, which
is used as the JFFS2 partition starting with the RT-AC66U
(patch by benoitm974)
- FIXED: JFFS2 partition couldn't be formatted for all routers but
the RT-N66U (wrong partition name).
Also resolved the case
where a second reboot was required to mount it.
- FIXED: RT-AC3200 port numbering was reversed on the Sysinfo page.
378.51 (6-Mar-2015)
- CHANGED: Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.0q (no real code change)
- CHANGED: Split the changelog into a separate file
- CHANGED: Added logging on custom config/script execution.
An error message will also be logged if those
are disabled while such a file is found.
- CHANGED: Allow pasting the password in some fields that would
disable it (patch by gfairchild)
- FIXED: RSSI not reported for guest clients (beta 1 regression)
- FIXED: DM failing to install on RT-AC66U (beta 1 regression)
378.51 Beta 1 (28-Feb-2015)
- IMPORTANT: The RT-N16 is no longer officially supported.
The increased
number of separate router platforms is becoming too much of
a burden for one single developer, as some features must be
implemented 2-3 separate times for different architectures.
The RT-N16 support will remain in the source code, so other
developers can still compile their own builds, and possibly
take over for supporting this older platform.
However, no new
features will be implemented, and it will no longer get
tested.
I still welcome external contributions if
someone else wants to take care of testing and providing
fixes to new issues.
- NEW: Added support for the RT-AC3200.
- NEW: ARM support for Entware, using Zyxmon's Qnapware repository.
- NEW: Re-designed Wireless Log page displaying connected wireless
clients.
The new page uses Ajax to automatically update
itself at a user-selected frequency, for near realtime
monitoring of your connected wifi clients.
- NEW: NAT loopback can now be chosen between Disable, Asus's original,
and Merlin's own (based on Phuzi0n's original DD-WRT design).
The
option can be found on the Firewall page.
- CHANGED: Reverted RT-AC66U driver to previous version as some users
were experiencing stability issues with the 3754 version.
- CHANGED: Updated p910nd to 0.97 to resolve incomplete print jobs
(patch by stsichler)
- CHANGED: Updated Samba to 3.6.25
- CHANGED: The Entware setup scripts will now backup any existing
installation rather than remove it (patch by TeHashX)
- CHANGED: Re-implemented our original NAT loopback code, with attempts
at reconfiguring it whenever the DPI engine is restarted.
This is still experimental, as most of the DPI engine is
closed source, so unsure if the loopback gets re-enabled
in every regular DPI restart scenarios.
- CHANGED: Disabled the offline default error page.
Clear your offline
content in your browser to fully get rid of it.
- CHANGED: Removed security warnings if FTP/Samba are configured to
allow unauthenticated users.
- FIXED: Issues when connecting with Russian ISPs relying on DHCP+VPN
(such as Beeline)
- FIXED: When enabling WAN access to webui, the router would always
forward both http and https ports regardless of if either of
these were disabled.
- FIXED: Shared printers over LPRng would sometime fail to
completely print the last page (patch by stsichler)
- FIXED: CVE-2015-0240 security issue in Samba 3.5.8 (used by
AiCloud).
The main Samba daemon was patched by the
update to 3.6.25.
378.50 (7-Feb-2015)
- IMPORTANT: You must do a factory default reset, and manually
reconfigure your setting if coming from a version
older than 378.50.
Failure to do so can
lead to various issues with wifi, OpenVPN,
and the new AC68U bootloader.
- IMPORTANT: Please read this changelog, especially the changes
related to jffs, user scripts/config and OpenVPN in
the previous 378.50 betas.
- NEW: Merged with Asus GPL 378_4129 code.
- CHANGED: Reverted back to vsftpd 2.x, as 3.0.2 doesn't work properly
on MIPS architectures (and possibly other particular
scenarios as well).
- CHANGED: Added warning to the DDNS page if you set the type
to Custom and either JFFS or custom script support isn't
enabled
- FIXED: A few unescaped quotes in the French dict breaking VPN pages
- FIXED: MAC list would get corrupted when removing and re-adding
entries on the MAC filter list
- FIXED: AC68U CFE update wasn't written to flash due to permission
issues
- FIXED: Static Key field wasn't visible when using HMAC authentication
- FIXED: syslogd was always enforcing the -S switch
- FIXED: When setting a static DHCP from the networkmap, the user-entered
name wouldn't be used.
Now it gets used, and we rely on the rc
daemon to properly handle it if it's not a valid hostname (it will
simply not provide it to dnsmasq's static name list).
378.50 Beta 2 (31-Jan-2015)
- NEW: Added custom config and postconf support for avahi, netatalk
and mt-daapd (iTunes server).
- CHANGED: Moved the AC68U CFE update process to the same location
as in GPL 3626 to see if it works more consistently.
- FIXED: Non-DPI build of AC56U had incompatible Tuxera modules
- FIXED: vsftpd wouldn't start if you had IPv6 enabled.
- FIXED: Asus had disabled the NAT loopback fix on MIPS's iptables
in GPL 3762.
Re-enabled.
- FIXED: Wireless clients that hadn't communicated in a while wouldn't
be properly shown on the Wireless log (patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: QoS rules weren't applied properly when IPv6 was enabled
(was changed in recent GPL - reverted it)
- FIXED: Can't apply a Custom DDNS if you don't have something entered
in the username/password fields (shown in other DDNS services)
- FIXED: NFS page wasn't properly loading
378.50 Beta 1 (25-Jan-2015)
- IMPORTANT: You must do a factory default reset, and manually
reconfigure your setting.
Failure to do so can
lead to various issues with wifi, OpenVPN,
and the new AC68U bootloader.
- IMPORTANT: Please read this changelog, especially the changes
related to jffs, user scripts/config and OpenVPN.
- NEW: Merged with Asus 378_3913 GPL code.
Most notable changes:
* Trend Micro DPI engine for RT-AC68U
* Updated Trend Micro engine for RT-AC87U
* Updated Quantenna firmware/driver
* Various updates to 3G/4G support and Dual WAN
- NEW: ddns-start user script, executed after the DDNS update
was launched (can be used to update additional services)
- NEW: Custom DDNS (handled through ddns-start script)
See the documentation for how to create such
a script.
- NEW: Option to enable support for custom scripts and
config files.
This option is disabled by default, so
if you have a broken script that prevents the router from
booting, doing a factory default reset will ensure that the
broken script won't be executed, and recover access to the
router.
This is necessary since the JFFS2 partition is
now enabled by default.
- CHANGED: Added logo to DNSFilter on the AiProtection
homepage (contributed by Piterel)
- CHANGED: Updated Openssl to 1.0.0p
- CHANGED: Merged Asus's newer NTP update code, with a fix
to prevent hourly log spam from the update process
when in a DST enabled timezone.
- CHANGED: Updated vsftpd to 3.0.2 (newer version used by
Asus on their Qualcomm-based routers)
- CHANGED: the qos-start script will be passed an argument
that will contain "init" (when setting up tc)
or "rules" (when setting up iptables).
- CHANGED: JFFS2 partition is now enabled by default, to be in
sync with Asus, who are starting to make use of this
partition.
- CHANGED: The Local IP in an IPv6 firewall rule can now be
left empty.
- CHANGED: Download Master will now be downloaded at install time
rather than included in the firmware, to increase the
amount of space available to JFFS - this matches
the AC56/AC68. (N16, N66)
- FIXED: Under certain conditions, the OpenVPN server page
would report an initializing state when it was
already running.
- FIXED: First OpenVPN client/server instance wasn't properly
run on the second CPU core, resulting in lower
performance (AC56/AC68/AC87)
- FIXED: Router IP wasn't advertised through DHCP as WINS
server if WINS was enabled
- FIXED: OpenVPN would crash if specifying "None" as
the cipher (regression in OpenVPN 2.3.6)
- FIXED: The "empty" category was removed by Asus a
few months ago, preventing you from removing
an assigned priority on the Adaptive QoS
page.
Re-added it.
- FIXED: Port triggers weren't written to the correct
iptables chain (Asus bug)
- FIXED: When moving from stock to this firmware, the OpenVPN
Server 1 instance gets automatically enabled because
Asus hardcodes "1" into the nvram setting that handles
start at wan.
Changed to a different nvram to resolve
this conflict.
This means everyone must re-enable their
OpenVPN server instance after upgrading from any version
before 376.50.
- FIXED: dnsmasq would run out of available leases if you had a
very small DHCP pool combined with many out-of-pool
reservations.
Now the limit will be either 253 or the
pool size, whichever is the largest (Asus issue)
- FIXED: SSHD port forwarding couldn't be enabled/disabled
- FIXED: DHCP log spam when using IPv6 with a Windows 8
client (patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: snmp exposes a lot of sensitive information such as
login credentials, therefore all the custom Asus MIBs
have been disabled.
- FIXED: Very long SSIDs with special characters/spaces in them
would be shown as "undefined" in the banner.
- FIXED: Curl would fail to access SSL sites due to lack of
a CA bundle.
376.49_5 (9-Jan-2015)
- FIXED: Vulnerability in infosvr (CVE-2014-9583) (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Additional security issue in infosvr (incorrect memcpy()
call) (Asus bug)
376.49_4 (27-Dec-2014)
- FIXED: WAN page error when entering a hostname, and broken
UPNP FAQ link
- FIXED: OpenVPN Server wasn't showing the Advertize DNS to
Client option (regression from 3677 merge)
- FIXED: bootloop when enabling Traditional QoS (or any other
feature that forces CTF to be disabled) due to
FA being left enabled (Asus bug) (AC87)
376.49_2 (23-Dec-2014)
- FIXED: Asus DDNS couldn't be configured on the webui
- FIXED: OpenVPN server wouldn't let you edit user accounts
- FIXED: Missing DLNA icon on clients (Asus bug) (N66, AC66)
376.49 (21-Dec-2014)
- NEW: Merged with Asus GPL 376_3677.
This new code
includes a lot of changes related to USB modem
support.
- NEW: IPv6 handling based on dnsmasq + odhcp6c.
This new
code which has been developped by Asus these past few
months but kept disabled so far has been enabled.
Initial tests show much better reliability with
different ISPs.
- NEW: Added IPv6 support to DNSFilter (currently only
Yandex has IPv6 servers).
Note that unlike IPv4
filtering, we cannot automatically NAT queries
to the desire server, so the current implementation
works like Asus's YandexDNS service, where IPv6 servers
are simply returned to DHCPv6/RA client queries,
and ip6tables ensures that you cannot override
them, by rejecting connection to other DNS servers.
- CHANGED: Merged newer DPI engine from 378_3123 beta
(AC87)
- CHANGED: Removed SSLv2 and v3 support from OpenSSL
(we had already stopped using these in
376.48, so this removes unused code)
- CHANGED: The VPN webui is now a bit closer to Asus's code.
This will mostly make it easier to keep in
sync with future changes to that UI by
Asus (they rearranged the layout a bit in
376_36xx).
- CHANGED: Updated OpenVPN to 2.3.6
- CHANGED: Reverted to Asus's max-lease number calculation
for dnsmasq
- CHANGED: Hide wireless key on settings page unless field
has focus (patch by John9527)
- CHANGED: Ported USB 3.0 (XHCI) kernel driver from
Netgear GPL (which seems to have in turn
backported it from upstream kernel 3.x)
- CHANGED: Updated Quantenna to v36.7.3.23 (AC87)
- FIXED: vsftpd wasn't properly compiled with SSL
support.
- FIXED: MAC filtering couldn't be disabled on Guest
networks (Asus bug) (Patch by John9527)
- FIXED: Various fixes and tweaks to the new IPv6
code from Pinwing and saintdev
- FIXED: Editing a client on the networkmap would
cause any matching DHCP reservation entry to
lost its hostname
- REMOVED: The web redirection control setting was
removed, as it is being replaced by the
(simpler) redirection setting Asus added
to the System page.
376.48_3 (20-Nov-2014)
- FIXED: NAT loopback was broken on MIPS devices
(backported Asus fix from 376_3626)
376.48_2 (8-Nov-2014)
- FIXED: Samba would fail to start on the RT-N16 due to a
missing library.
376.48_1 (7-Nov-2014)
- FIXED: Max-lease calculation Asus introduced in 376_2769 is
broken - re-hardcode it to 253 like they used to do in
previous release.
Will be properly fixed once they
release a newer GPL with this issue resolved.
(Asus bug)
376.48 (7-Nov-2014)
- NEW: Added the RT-AC68P to the list of supported devices
- CHANGED: Use sha256 checksums instead of MD5 for improved
security when validating your downloads.
(note: checksums are also posted on the support
forum at SmallNetBuilder)
- CHANGED: Switched my fix for unmounted/hidden partition
support with Asus's own fix from GPL 3561.
- FIXED: Samba would fail to start if the router admin username contained
upper case characters.
Samba was modified to have it try to
local the UNIX user as provided (it was previously only
trying upper and lower case versions) (Samba 3.6 bug)
376.48 Beta 3 (02-Nov-2014)
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to release 1.9 (plus upstream PCP fix)
- FIXED: Couldn't edit share permissions for Samba if your disk
contained an unmounted/hidden partition (Asus bug in 2769)
- FIXED: Couldn't edit share permissions for Samba for the RT-N66U
internal SDcard reader (Asus bug in 2769)
- FIXED: Missing Max User field to Samba page (Asus bug)
376.48 Beta 2 (26-Oct-2014)
- NEW: Added logo to the webui header
- CHANGED: Samba 3.6 will now use libiconv to handle
charset conversion (will resolve CP850
warnings amongst other things)
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 20141023 code from Github.
- CHANGED: Updated dropbear to 2014.66.
- CHANGED: Reverted NTP update code to GPL 2678 in hopes of
resolving the few cases where it didn't work anymore.
- FIXED: minidlna is once again able to use inotify for updates.
A temporary workaround has been implemented where
minidlna will be staticly linked with a threadsafe
build of sqlite3, while BWDPI will continue to use
the shared non-threadsafe library. (Asus bug)
376.48 Beta 1 (18-Oct-2014)
- NEW: Merged with Asus 376_2769 AC87 GPL
- NEW: Enabled numerous modules in net-snmp (based on the list
used by OpenWRT)
- NEW: Added postconf and custom config support for snmpd.conf
- NEW: Added HID support to ARM kernel (AC56,AC68,AC87)
- CHANGED: Reverted NAT loopback code to Asus's, since our own
code is currently broken by recent FW code changes.
- CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.0o, resolving a few security issues.
- CHANGED: Disabled SSLv2 and SSLv3 support for https access to the
router webui.
IE6 users, your time is up - upgrade.
TLS 1.0 is now the only supported protocol.
- CHANGED: upgraded main Samba server from 3.0.x to 3.6.24.
This might
cause a slight drop in performance, but should improve
both reliability and security.
- FIXED: DNSFilter client list dropdown would sometime be empty.
- FIXED: DNS queries run on the router were forwarded to upstream
nameservers instead of the local dnsmasq
- FIXED: Re-added the USB HID kernel module needed for UPS monitoring
(patch by ryzhov_al)
- FIXED: Incorrect top margin on some pages such as AiCloud, and
stretched font on the progress splash (Asus bug)
- FIXED: URL and keyword filtering wasn't working under certain
situations when CTF was enabled
- FIXED: Mac Filtering wasn't working with Guest networks
(Asus bug) (Patch by saintdev)
- FIXED: Chosing a client on the MAC Filter page wasn't properly
filling the Name field.
Also reorganized layout a bit.
376.47 (20-Sept-2014)
- NEW: Added sha256 and sha512 HMAC support to dropbear (SSH)
- CHANGED: Moved OpenVPN postconf scripts right before server/client
gets started, so you can also use them to modify the other
generated files such as the exported ovpn config file.
- FIXED: SSHD options visibility (patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: EMF/IGMP settings were reverting to the select profile
default (Asus bug introduced in GPL 2678)
- FIXED: PPTP account list failed to display (regression in Beta 1)
- FIXED: VPN server page was switching back to PPTP when changing
OpenVPN unit and you were initially on the PPTP page
- FIXED: Activity indicator wasn't shown during a networkmap
scan
376.47 Beta 1 (14-Sept-2014)
- NEW: Merged with Asus GPL 2678 (AC87)
- NEW: Report Quantenna FW version on Sysinfo page
- NEW: Enabled experimental FTP and Samba Cloud Sync support in AiCloud.
This feature is still in development by Asus, so it might not be
fully functional yet.
- NEW: Enabled experimental SNMPD support, under Administration -> SNMP.
This feature is still in development by Asus, so it might not be
fully functional yet. (not available on the RT-N16)
- NEW: Added option to enable WAN access to SNMPD, defaults to disabled.
(Asus's implementation has it open to the WAN by default)
- CHANGED: Re-increased max allowed FTP user limit to 10 (was reverted
to 5 in the GPL merge when the setting was moved to the
FTP page)
- FIXED: PPTPD was getting enabled every time you clicked Apply while on
the PPTPD VPN Server page
376.46 (26-Aug-2014)
- NEW: Merged with Asus GPL 2061.
This is essentially
the new QTN driver for the AC87.
- FIXED: Various webui issues with IE10/IE11 (patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: OpenVPN Client page was visible on the RT-N16
- FIXED: DHCP pool validation error on VPN Server advanced page.

enabled anymore (regression in 376.44) (Patch by
Sinshiva)
- FIXED: 5 GHz N+AC mode was incorrectly setting router to
N-only mode (Asus bug, fix backported from 2381,
additional fix by me for AC66)
- FIXED: PControl page failing to display on French and
Italian locales (Asus bug)
- FIXED: IPv6 can occasionally fail to work properly when
using a PPPoE WAN interface (patch by pinwing)
376.44 (3-Aug-2014)
IMPORTANT: Make a backup of your JFFS partition if upgrading
an RT-AC56U or RT-AC68U and you have stored files
on that partition!
The partition layout has been
changed.
- NEW: Merged with Asus's 376_2044 GPL.
Summary of changes:
* New networkmap, lets users edit device names,
assign icons to devices, etc...
* Reworked IPv6 support
* New filesystem driver provider for NTFS/HFS+/FAT
* Webui visual update
* Updated components (minidlna, radvd, dnsmasq)
- NEW: Added support for RT-AC87U.
- CHANGED: Updated N66U wireless driver to Asus's 1071 build
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to Git head (as of 20140731)
- CHANGED: The JFFS partition on ARM devices now uses
Asus's code, which means the whole unused space
is now used for the JFFS partition.
(AC56, AC68)
- CHANGED: Made all ARM models use the new filesystem drivers from Tuxera,
resulting in general improved USB disk performance (and
hopefully improved reliability as well) (AC56, AC68)
- CHANGED: The wifi notification icon will now report
channel and channel width for the 5 GHz band,
as the extension channel wasn't always accurately
reported.
- CHANGED: Reworked layout of SSH settings on System page (based
on Asus's own WIP)
- CHANGED: Allow FQDN (hostname + domain) rather than just
hostnames on the WAN page (some ISPs require that)
- FIXED: Missing mDNSResponder daemon preventing mt-daapd
from working on MIPS devices (N16,N66,AC66)
- FIXED: System Log wouldn't properly be positioned
at the bottom (Patch by John9527)
- FIXED: DNSFilter clients configured to bypass DNSFilter
would still be prevented from using an IPv6 DNS.
- FIXED: Incorrect IPv6 prefix if not a multiple of 8
(patch by NickZ)
- FIXED: OpenVPN firewall cleanup was missing rules
(patch by sinshiva)
- FIXED: Minidlna issues with Philips smart TVs
- FIXED: SSHD brute force protection wasn't working if
Dual WAN was enabled and set to LB mode.
- FIXED: Miniupnpd error flood in Syslog when using a
Plex server on your LAN (fix from upstream)
- REMOVED: Reverted various IPv6-related patches as they
conflicted with Asus's own changes.
These might
make it back at a later time if deemed
necessary.
- REMOVED: Removed layer7 filtering support in Netfilter from
ARM devices due to compatibility issues (AC56,AC68)
- REMOVED: Removed IPsec support from ARM devices due to
compatibility issues (AC56, AC68)
374.43_2 (7-June-2014)
- FIXED: NTFS disks couldn't be mounted (Paragon driver not
loading due to a kernel change) (AC56, AC68)
374.43 (6-June-2014)
- NEW: User-configurable refresh period to trigger a DDNS
update after a certain number of days.
- CHANGED: dnsmasq option 252 now defaults to an empty string,
to silence broken clients such as Win7.
Important: if you were previously using a customized
252 reply (to use with a valid wpad/pac file), you
will need to use a postconf script to change the
default config instead of appending your own
config.
If you use DNS-based WPAD setting, you will need
to remove the 252 option using postconf, as IE will
not query for the DNS entry if there is a 252
option through DHCP, even if it fails to connect to it.
- CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 1.8.20140523.
- CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.0m.
- CHANGED: More backports from OpenSSL 1.0.2, improving SHA
performance on ARM routers.
- CHANGED: The JFFS2 partition is now disabled by default after
a factory default reset.
- FIXED: Media server page wouldn't let you enable the iTunes
server unless you also enabled DLNA (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Restricted guests still had access to the router (Asus
bug introduced in GPL 4887)
- FIXED: 6in4 traffic wasn't bypassing CTF if dualwan mode was
either disabled or set to failover mode (AC56/AC68)
- FIXED: Single character workgroups were rejected as invalid
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: Networks with SSIDs containing single quotes
would break the client list (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Traffic Monitor results are wrong on PPPoE connections
(Asus bug) (Patch by pinwing, additional debugging
by fantom1)
- FIXED: Crash if entering close to 64 MACs plus their names on
the MAC filter page.
374.42_2 (16-May-2014)
- FIXED: Time Machine support (AC56, AC68)
374.42 (9-May-2014)
- NEW: Merged with Asus's 374_5656 GPL.
- NEW: Added Comodo Secure DNS to supported DNSFilter services
- FIXED: Download2 folder wasn't selectable anymore on the
Media Server page.
- FIXED: Pass correct valid and preferred lifetime to radvd when
using DHCPv6-PD (Patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: IPv6 connectivity could be lost after 1-2 hours due
to the time shift caused by NTP at boot time
(Patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: Various IPv6 connectivity issues related to services
being (re)started at the wrong time, or twice.
(Patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: Build system would sometime try to use the local system's
header/libs - use a pkg-config wrapper to avoid this
issue (Patch by ppuryear)
- FIXED: Erratic 5G led blinking behaviour as the watchdog's software-
based blinking was constantly writing to the wireless chip's
registers for led control. (AC68)
- FIXED: LEDs weren't all turning back on when coming out of
Stealth Mode (AC56)
- CHANGED: Make the router use dnsmasq for internal name
resolution rather than directly using the WAN DNS.
- CHANGED: Upgraded OpenVPN to 2.3.4.
- CHANGED: Upgraded miniupnpd to 1.8.20140422 (PCP-related fixes)
374.41 (18-Apr-2014)
- NEW: Merged with Asus's 374_5047 GPL.
Notable changes:
* Fixed RT-AC68U random reboots
* Additionnal security fixes
* Improved Media server, SMB and FTP webui
* minidlna and radvd updates
- NEW: PCP support (Port Control Protocol)
- NEW: Option to allow/deny FTP access from WAN.
Default is to
reject WAN connections.
The option can be found on the
USB Servers -> FTP Share
- NEW: Option to control web redirection while Internet is
down (configurable on the WAN page).
- CHANGED: Upgraded miniupnpd to 1.8.20140401.
- CHANGED: Disk idle exclusion now supports up to 9 disks.
- FIXED: WOL wasn't working (Asus bug in 4887/5047)
- FIXED: Replaced webui glue with permanent concrete.
It won't
fall again.
- FIXED: Language dropdown not properly shown with 8-bit
characters.
- FIXED: Comcast's IPv6 network would flood the LAN with
neighbour solicitation packets, which should normally
not cross beyond their modem.
There is now an ip6tables
rule to filter out those packets, preventing your log
from being spammed with table overflows.
The filter is
is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the
"ipv6_neighsol_drop" nvram setting to "0". (rule suggested
by diplomat7)
- FIXED: EMF wasn't properly configured after wireless was
restarted (patch from Vahur)
- FIXED: Router crashing when more than around 30 static routes
were entered
- FIXED: webui would die for some users when accessing the VPN Server
config page and there were connected OpenVPN clients
- FIXED: Added missing iptables-save on ARM platform (AC56, AC68)
- FIXED: nvram factory default reset would sometime fail on MIPS
devices (N16, N66, AC66) (Patch by ryzhov_al)
- FIXED: Under a certain situation the router could lose track of
whether an OpenVPN server/client instance was running or not.
This could result in the webui trying to restart it, and
returning an error message because it was already running.
- REMOVED: The Media server database location is no longer
configurable, as we've switched to Asus's new
automatic location selection.
- REMOVED: Removed the Run Cmd page as it was a security
risk.
This is also needed to keep in line with
recent security fixes Asus applied to the
httpd backend to limit what external processes
it can run, otherwise any malicious page could
run arbitrary commands on your router if you
were currently logged on a separate tab.
374.40 (6-March-2014)
- KNOWN ISSUE: Some people are experiencing random reboots
with the RT-AC68U running firmwares based on recent Asus GPL.
If you are are affected, please revert to 374.40 alpha4 for now.
Asus are looking into the issue, which affects this model since
374_4422.
- FIXED: Asuswrt was calling wl_defaults() every time the
wifi was restarted, causing Regulation Mode to be
overwritten.
Now we force it to h mode if the
router model and region requires DFS compliance
(same as Asus's code, except we won't enforce
it to off in other scenarios, and will only do
so if it was previously set to off).
- FIXED: Advanced wireless page broken on Internet Explorer, due
to missing Array.IndexOf() support in IE (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Incorrect model detection prevented CPU temperature
from being shown on the Sysinfo page on the "R" SKUs.
374.40 Beta 2 (5-March-2014)
- FIXED: Numerous buffer overruns in networkmap that would result
in crashes or empty/incomplete device list.
Was often
visible on networks hosting a Windows Home Server machine.
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: Site survey was reporting 5G as being disabled on RT-N16.
- FIXED: Various issues related to the helper.sh script for postconf
- FIXED: The OpenVPN instance wasn't restarted if it was currently
stopped due to a syntax error in its config and you had
just corrected it.
- FIXED: Restarting the wireless service would stop emf/igs snooping
until they were manually restarted/recconfigured. (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Channels above 153 were missing on 5 GHz band if width
is set to 40 MHz (Asus bug)
- FIXED: reg_mode was being enforced to "h" (EU region) or "off"
(others) since GPL 4422.
We now stick again to what's
set in the webui by the end user.
- FIXED: Allow LAN traffic while dualwan mode is set to lb (issue
caused by the default policy fix in beta 1)
374.40 Beta 1 (1-March-2014)
- NEW: Merged with Asus's 374_4561 GPL.
Notable changes:
* Various security-related fixes
* Redesigned Parental Control webui
* Notification in case of insecure configuration
- NEW: Added OpenDNS Family Shield support to DNSFilter
- NEW: Added support for up to three user-defined servers to DNSFilter
- NEW: Added option to force DNSfilter clients to always use the DNS
provided to them by the router's DHCP server (which will be
the router itself if you didn't change it on the DHCP
webui page)
- NEW: Option to disable the DHCP6 Server (code contributed by
kdarbyshirebryant)
- CHANGED: The RT-N66U is now compiled with EM enabled
by default.
That means there will no longer be a separate
experimental build for this.
- CHANGED: Updated dropbear to 2014.63
- CHANGED: New type of glue for the webui header
- CHANGED: Switched to a shorter version numbering scheme
- FIXED: RT-N16 firmware (missing files were obtained from
the new GPL release Asus made for this model)
- FIXED: Last24 page wasn't properly displaying the
Avg value (regression in 374.39)
- FIXED: Clients with a configured IPv6 DNS would bypass
DNSFilter.
DNSFilter-enabled clients will now
be prevented from using IPv6 nameservers, forcing
them through the (IPv4-only) filtering nameserver
- FIXED: DNSFilter clients set to "None" would still be
forced through your WAN-configured nameservers,
preventing nameservers configured on the clients
from working.
Now they will fully ignore the DNSFilter
settings.
- FIXED: The global DNSFilter would sometime not get properly
configured in the firewall.
- FIXED: When the firewall was disabled, the FORWARD chain
policy was still left to "DROP" - changed to "ACCEPT".
- FIXED: typo in SMB config ("use spne go") (Asus bug)
- FIXED: PPPoE with an MTU of 1500 requires the WAN interface
to have its MTU set at 1508 (patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: IPv6 Prefix Delegation issues (patch by pinwing)
- FIXED: MTU setting on IPv6 connections (patch by pinwing)
3.0.0.4.374.39 (31-Jan-2014)
This version isn't available for the RT-N16 as support for the
SDK5 platform is currently broken in the latest GPL sources.
- NEW: Merged with Asus 374_583 GPL.
Notable changes:
* USB hub support
- NEW: DNS-based filtering.
Under Parental Control there is
now a new tab called DNS Filter where you can enable
a DNS-based filtering service, and apply a specific
filter both globally and on a per-client basis.
Supported
are: OpenDNS, Norton Connect Safe and YandexDNS.
- NEW: helper.sh script, to simplify creation of postconf
scripts.
See the postconf section for details.
- CHANGED: Discontinued SDK5 builds for the RT-N66U.
The new EM
builds resolved wifi range issues by running the SDK6
driver set in Engineering Mode (driver provided by Asus).
Look in the Experimental folder for the EM build - it will
eventually become the standard build for the N66U once
it gets sufficiently tested.
You might need to do a
factory default reset after switching to an EM build,
for best results.
- CHANGED: Re-switched back to rp-pppoe 3.11 since nobody confirmed
that 3.10 worked better for them.
- CHANGED: Allow PPPoE MTU up to 1500, for ISPs that support RFC 4638.
- CHANGED: Additional webui performance improvement by caching CSS.
- FIXED: DHCPv6 client failing to start if the router username was
changed from "admin" (Asus bug) (patch from Saintdev)
- FIXED: DHCPv6 client failing to request an IP with some ISPs
such as Comcast (Asus bug) (patch from Saintdev)
- FIXED: SMB shares were accessible over WAN, bypassing Netfilter
(Asus bug) (AC56/AC68)
- FIXED: USB read speed would be limited by the QoS upstream
configuration (Asus bug) (AC56/AC68)
- FIXED: Resolution of local machines with domain appended would fail
when using a nameserver that does not return nxdomain errors
(such as OpenDNS) (Asus bug)
The new behaviour is configurable on the LAN-> DHCP page,
in case you run your own nameserver which is expected to
handle both local and remote domains.
Default is to not
forward these (to allow OpenDNS to work properly).
- FIXED: OpenVPN Client page - changing the local IP wouldn't always be
properly saved.
- FIXED: Well-known services not properly applying settings on the
Network Services Filtering page (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Webui crash when importing an ovpn with invalid cert/keys
- FIXED: resolv.conf not reverted to its original content after an
OpenVPN client that gets DNS pushed to it would disconnect.
- FIXED: The average rates on the realtime traffic page would be
calculated based on the max number of samples (300) instead of
the currently collected number of samples (Asus bug)
- REMOVED: YandexDNS has been removed, since its functionality is now
provided by the new DNSFilter.
3.0.0.4.374.38_2 (17-Jan-2014):
- CHANGED: Improved webui responsiveness by instructing the browser
to cache images.
- CHANGED: Reverted minidlna to 374.37 code.
While the latest code
brings some fixes, it seems to also break functionality
for a small number of users.
Too many low-level changes
from the minidlna author to make it easy to debug.
- FIXED: Syntax error in DHCPv6 client config (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Domain field wasn't clearly identified on the webui
when DDNS set to Namecheap (Saintdev)
- FIXED: Missing carriage return in dnsmasq.conf when PPTP VPN
is enabled, causing LAN name resolution issues.
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: A few unescaped quotes in the French dict would break
some webui pages (such as the Wireless page).
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: OpenVPN server export would always export the first
server instance configuration.
- FIXED: Bogus "Config file is missing" error logged by pptpd when
it was starting (Asus bug)
- FIXED: "Advertise DNS" wasn't visible if the page was loaded and
"Respond to DNS" was already enabled.
3.0.0.4.374.38_1 (12-Jan-2014):
- FIXED: Tools -> Run Cmd page wasn't working (regression
in 374.38)
- FIXED: Router getting stuck on various webui changes due
to a broken precompiled emf module (AC56/AC68)
3.0.0.4.374.38 (11-Jan-2014):
This version isn't available for the RT-N16 or the SDK5 build
of the RT-N66U as support for the SDK5 platform is currently
broken.
Please stick to 374.36 Beta 1 for the time being on
these two platforms.
Note that the RT-N66U did get a newer wifi driver, so give it a
try, as it might have resolved or at least improved on the wifi
range issues.
Remember to do a factory default reset if switching from SDK5 to
SDK6 builds!
Keep a backup of your existing settings in case you
decide to revert back to an SDK5 build.
- NEW: Merged with 374_2078 GPL provided by Asus (From RT-N66U).
Notable changes:
* Updated SDK for MIPS devices - 6.30.163.2002 (r382208)
* PPPoE HW acceleration should be fixed by the new SDK
* Updated AiCloud closed source components (MIPS)
- CHANGED: Reverted Parental Control code to our fixed code,
as I see Asus is still making fixes to their own
code past version 2078.
- CHANGED: Updated AC56 and AC68U wifi driver and CTF to
January 3rd builds (provided by Asus)
- FIXED: emf/igs userspace tools were missing on ARM devices

* dnsmasq updated to 2.68
* radvd updated to 1.9.5
* Improved IPv6 support
* Fixed Parental Control (A-M's own fix was replaced with
this new one for consistency)
* More details shown on Wireless Log page (their changes
were merged with our own changes)
- CHANGED: Dropbear default path will now include the locations
inside /opt
- CHANGED: Don't include a cert/key section in exported .ovpn if the
router has "User authentication only" enabled
- CHANGED: Display in which chain a given port forward rule is, on the
Port Forwarding page.
Allows to distinguish manual forwards
from upnp forwards.

on the VPN Status page.
- CHANGED: Removed the display of global OpenVPN statistics on the
VPN Status page.
- CHANGED: Upgraded AiCloud binary components on MIPS routers to
374_1631 build (N16/N66/AC66)

setting dnsmasq to use "strict-order"
- FIXED: Garbled resolv.conf generated when adding an OpenVPN client DNS
to it
- FIXED: OpenVPN Client static key was incorrectly processed when shown
on the webui.
3.0.0.4.374.36 Beta 1 (23-Dec-2013):
- NEW: Added ECDSA key support for SSH
- NEW: postconf scripts.
This allow you to modify a generated
config file (for example, smb.conf) before the service
using it gets started.
- NEW: layer7 Netfilter module on ARM devices (AC56, AC68).
Note: traffic accounting must be manually enabled on
these devices (see the Layer7 section in the FW's README)
- CHANGED: Updated dropbear to 2013.62
- CHANGED: Improved rendering of the VPN Status page
- CHANGED: Extended retry period for WAN DHCP queries to 160 secs
in Normal DHCP mode to give time to Charter to
unblacklist customers being accidentally blocked by them.
- CHANGED: Downgraded rp-pppoe from 3.11 to 3.10 to see if it's
more stable for some PPPoE users
- FIXED: Some VPN client username/passwords were incorrectly handled
- FIXED: When disabling Dual WAN, WAN unit wasn't being reset to
unit 0, preventing users from editing the correct unit
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: If you replaced the Asus generated CA with your own, the
exported ovpn file would contain your CA with the
Asus-signed client cert/key.
Now, we only insert the
client cert/key if it was signed by the current CA.
- FIXED: MSS clamping for clients connecting to the PPTPD server
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: networkmap's DLNA detection was broken with some devices,
and could result in very long delays during scan (Asus bug)

- CHANGED: Added a VPN mode selector on the VPN Server Details page.
- FIXED: JS error on the VPN Server Details page related to PPTP
- FIXED: Clicking on "Apply" on VPN Details page would fail to
apply your new settings to a running OpenVPN server.
- FIXED: Some port forward rules were incorrectly generated when
in load-balancing mode (Asus bug)
- FIXED: After adding/removing a user to OpenVPN Server, the password
file was not immediately updated.
Note that this fix will
break backward compatibility with Asus as the nvram value
storing the list of OpenVPN user/pass had to be renamed
(so not to be instanced).
- FIXED: VPN client not working on MIPS devices (N66/AC66).
- FIXED: Various formatting issues with generated client.ovpn file
3.0.0.4.374.35_2 (24-Nov-2013):
- FIXED: updown.sh script location was changed in
339, causing issues with OpenVPN clients
3.0.0.4.374.35 (24-Nov-2013):
- NEW: Merged with Asus 374_339 GPL (from RT-AC68U).
Asus added some new features in this release:
* Support for HFS+ and Time Machine (AC56/AC68U only)
* OpenVPN support.
Their implementation uses the backend
code from Asuswrt-Merlin but with a more
simplistic, novice-friendly webui.
This required
adapting the current webui to be able to retain some
of their improvements without sacrificing the
flexibility of being able to have two separate server
and client configurations.
- NEW: Support for Namecheap DDNS (Patch provided by saintdev)
- NEW: Added qos-start user script
- FIXED: Incorrect range validation for UPnP ports on WAN page.
- FIXED: Accidentaly lock out of webui due to software hammering
the router's webui without valid login credentials
- FIXED: NAT Loopback broken with CTF enabled (AC56/AC68) (Asus bug)
- FIXED: Backing up your settings would return an empty CFG file.
- FIXED: Kernel panic when inserting ebtables rule (AC56/AC68,
fix backported from kernel 2.6.37)
- FIXED: If an IP/CIDR on the IPv6 firewall page was long enough
to be shortened with "..." it would be incorrectly saved.
- CHANGED: IPTraffic will now account for traffic going through
an OpenVPN tunnel
- CHANGED: VPN webui is now an hybrid of our original webui,
along with Asus's own.
This allows the addition
of these features developed by Asus:
* Ability to export an ovpn config file to give to
your clients
* Support for username/password authentcation on
the built-in server
* Ability to import a tunnel provider's .ovpn
config file to configure a client connection
on the router

Asuswrt-Merlin).
- NEW: Merged with Asus 374_726 code from RT-AC66U GPL.
Notable changes:
* RT-N66U now based on the SDK6 driver.
This resolved the
numerous connectivity issues, at the expense of a shorter
range (a separate SDK5 build based on driver 5.100 is
available in the Experimental folder as an alternative).
* AiCloud 2.0
- NEW: Added bonding.ko kernel module.

listens on a TCP socket.
- FIXED: Samba binding to WAN interface would cause warnings
about WINS/master browser (regression in 374)
- FIXED: The ARM kernel was missing the Advanced IP Routing option,
preventing some of the "ip" command functions from
working (was breaking Astrill's plugin) (RT-AC56U)
- FIXED: With FW 374 Asus changed the Samba priority from too high to
too low (-19), resulting in poor sharing performance.
I changed it to a priority of 0, providing more balanced
performance. (N16/N66/AC66)
- FIXED: Some fields would allow invalid characters (such as
single quotes) which might break the webui JS.
There might
still be a few unprotected fields.
- FIXED: Memory leak in httpd service (Asus bug)

where it wouldn't write back its cleared
format flag.
- FIXED: Restarting the wireless service would break
stealth mode.
- FIXED: The new thumbnail cache code Asus added in build 720's
minidlna will prevent scanning from completing on very
large collections.
Reverted that code for now.
- FIXED: Wireless key field was automatically activated on
page load, which could lead to accidental changes
(issue introduced in 374_720).
- FIXED: Router believed that NTP wasn't properly working after a
LAN or wireless service restart (issue introduced in
374_720).
- FIXED: IPv6 client list was incorrectly displayed if a client
didn't have a known hostname (Asus bug)
3.0.0.4.374.32 (24-Aug-2013):

traffic to be forwarded to your LAN devices.
This new option
(enabled by default) will prevent traffic forwarding to LAN
devices.
You can also create firewall rules to allow inbound
traffic to specific hosts.
The firewall configuration can be
accessed through the "Firewall -> IPv6 Firewall" page.

This router has a new model of flash, you can NOT
use any older FW on these. (RT-N66U)
3.0.0.4.372.30_2 (7-July-2013):
(note: since people always thought adding a "b" meant "beta'

- NEW: Wireless site survey (on the Wireless tab)
- NEW: openvpn-event user script that gets run when a tunnel goes
up/down.
Read the OpenVPN documentation on the "up" and
"down" events for more on how to use this script, and to use
the passed parameters.
- NEW: Enabled sftp support in Dropbear (the sftp server must be
installed from Entware)
- NEW: Option to prevent SSH port hammering (patch submited by dodava)
- CHANGED: Merged with webui pages extract from the Asus released FW,
as they were more recent than the GPL ones
- CHANGED: Port state on Sysinfo page now uses the new OUI lookup
code from Asus
- CHANGED: Try to report on Sysinfo what is forcing HW acceleration
to be disabled
- FIXED: Build 354 reduced minimum syslog level to WARNING - bumped
back to INFO as in previous versions (resolves DHCP events
not being logged).
Also ensured we readjusted it if DHCP
logging is enabled, to handle routers that got upgraded
with the new loglevel already set.
- FIXED: Port numbering on the Sysinfo page for devices that has
them backward (untested) (RT-N16)
- FIXED: Client list wasn't using the new OUI code from Asus (was
missing from the GPL archive)
- FIXED: LAN traffic going through the NAT loopback would be counted
in the Per IP traffic monitoring.
- FIXED: IE rendering of the Other Settings page when toggling Per
IP monitoring
- FIXED: Cannot set webui to HTTPS-only (causes port conflict error)
(Asus bug in 354)
- FIXED: Cannot create/modify folders in AiDisk
- FIXED: Couldn't resolve LAN hostnames if WAN was down (the web
redirection would hijack all DNS queries).
Now, we let
dnsmasq handle both LAN and redirected queries.
- FIXED: Fixed support for Broadcom Wimax devices
- FIXED: smbpasswd wasn't properly updated when deleting a user
(Asus bug)
- FIXED: Aicloud: handling of disks with multiple partitions on the
webui (Asus bug) (fix submitted by hshang)
3.0.0.4.354.27 Beta 1 (31-Mar-2013):
- NEW: Merged with 3.0.0.4.354.
Notable changes:
* New wireless driver
* New Network Tools
* WOL (Under Network Tools
* HW acceleration support for PPPoE
* DHCP Normal/aggressive behaviour.
Similar to the 270.25
implementation, except it can be enabled/disabled
Asus considers build 354 to still be beta, so be advised that
there might still be some issues left (there are known issues
related to 3G/4G dongles for instance).
- CHANGED: Removed WOL webui - Asus added their own WOL support
on
the Network Tools page.
You will have
to re-add your
WOL entries.
- CHANGED: Removed System Log -> Connections page, and integrated it
into the new Network Tools -> Netstat page from Asus (as
NAT Connections)
- CHANGED: Removed wol binary, since Asus's WOL page uses ether-wake.
- CHANGED: Removed option to control SIP helper on Firewall page
(use the new Asus option from WAN - NAT PAssthrough page
instead)
- CHANGED: WPS button when set as a radio toggle will now behave the
same way as Asus's firmware: pressing it will fully
enable/disable both radios in the webui, rather than just
toggle the state of the enabled radios.
This means the
button will override the webui, and radio states will
survive reboots.
- FIXED: Avoid duplicate shares when using simpler share naming
using Asus's code from 354)
- FIXED: Improved fdisk support for 4KB sector size
- FIXED: openvpn: Client-specific entries weren't properly parsed
- FIXED: dnsmasq warning in syslog if DHCP static leases are disabled
3.0.0.4.270.26b (17-Mar-2013):

code to validate hostnames and volume labels)
3.0.0.4.270.26 (15-Mar-2013):
- NEW: ipset Netfilter support + userspace tool to create ipset lists.
- CHANGED: Router's hostname is now set all the time, regardless of
telnet/ssh states (and including in AP mode)
- CHANGED: Added device name field on the LAN page, since it's now
relevant to the router's hostname (not just SMB).
Left
it on the SMB page as well, for those used to see it there.
- CHANGED: Router will supply its device name when requesting an IP
while in AP mode.
- CHANGED: Various webui lists were increased from 32 to 128 entries
allowed.
- CHANGED: Improved networkmap:
* Will also use DHCP hostnames and user-defined static
names instead of just NetBIOS names
* Client list will show an animation while networkmap is
still busy scanning and resolving device names
* Dropdown menus that use Networkmap to build a list
of devices will also display names in addition to IP/MAC.
- CHANGED: Don't restart the whole network if you only changed DHCP
reservations (LAN -> DHCP page)
- FIXED: Openvpn: Non-CBC ciphers weren't working (their use is still
not recommended)
- FIXED: Proxy auto-configuration support (Asus bug)
3.0.0.4.270.25b (3-Mar-2013):
- FIXED: Disabling DHCP logging would cause a syntax error in
dnsmasq's configuration (regression from dnsmasq update)

select a location to store your traffic data files.
- CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to 2.65 (backported from 3.0.0.4.334)
- CHANGED: Enabled additional optimizations for openssl and openvpn
for a significant performance gain
- CHANGED: Reverted wireless driver to build 220 (RT-AC66U only)
- FIXED: Added missing badblocks program
- FIXED: Timing issues under IE where resolved device names would
not display on certain pages (such as the Sysinfo page)
- FIXED: VPN client "common name" wasn't getting saved
- FIXED: DHCP client will be less aggressive in attempting to obtain
a lease (wait 2 mins instead of 20 secs between attempts),
should help with ISPs like Charter who will blacklist you
if you send too many Discovery packets in a short period of
time.
- FIXED: Made profile.add be run after any Optware profile, so the
user changes will have priority over anything else.
- FIXED: WOL list corruption when removing an entry in some browsers
- FIXED: No longer forward packets with a LAN IP as destination
(Asus bug, fixed CDRouter test firewall_2)
- FIXED: IPv6 WAN would have the wrong prefix length (Asus bug, patch
submitted by PiotrKa)

lease page.
- CHANGED: Updated to OpenVPN 2.3.0 and lzo 2.06.
- CHANGED: Updated Busybox to 1.20.2 (with Oleg/wl500g patches
re-applied).
Lots of fixes, including GPT support in
fdisk.
- CHANGED: Updated Miniupnpd to version 1.8.
NOTE: previous

due to DNS issues.
- CHANGED: System log starts at the bottom (backported from GPL 314)
- CHANGED: Dual WAN is no longer enabled in regular builds - too many
issues with it at this point.
Regular USB failover

- NEW: Rebased on 3.0.0.4.260.
This version should
resolve issues with some Russian ISPs.

Reverted "switch" to "toggle" code to
prevent this.
- FIXED: You couldn't disable DMZ by clearing the IP field.
- FIXED: You couldn't edit entered text in DHCP/MAC/etc name field
- FIXED: clientid passing for some ISPs requiring it (like Sky UK)
was broken with the DHCP client change of build 220.
- FIXED: No longer reboot the router three times during boot time if
one of the radios is disabled by the user. (RT-N66U)
- FIXED: Changing the router login name to anything other than "admin"
would prevent radvd, ecmh and the cru script from working
properly - they all assumed "admin".
Made then use
http_username instead (which is tied to the superuser)
- CHANGED: Improved SMB and vsftpd read performance by up to 30%
3.0.0.4.246.19b (26-Oct-2012):
- FIXED: Reverted wireless driver to build 220 version as the new

if the RSSI is reported as "??".
3.0.0.4.220.18 (23-Sept-2012):
- NEW: Added OpenVPN logging verbosity setting (vpn_loglevel, must be
manually set to a value between 0 and 15, with 3 being the default).
- FIXED: Buffer overrun in init code that would crash the router when
too many features were enabled at compile time.
- FIXED: Re-enabled DualWAN (RT-N66U, RT-AC66U)
- FIXED: Re-enabled Beceem (Wimax) support in RT-AC66U.

- NEW: Added crontab command
- FIXED: (RT-AC66U) Would crash when accessing a LAN device through either
VPN or the NAT Loopback (GRO is now disabled for that device)

other firewall rules (firewall-start changes to the nat table are
being overwritten when the router starts NAT)

3.0.0.3.157.12 Beta:
This is based on unreleased Asus code, which they have
graciously provided me with.
- NEW: Rebased on 3.0.0.3.157.
Notable changes from Asus:
. IPv6 tunnel memory leak fixed
. They fixed many issues, making some of my patches
no longer necessary, such as timezone DST, https auth, etc...
. Upgraded radvd
- NEW: Added link to the command shell page in Tools menu.
- NEW: (RT-N16) Enabled power settings (EXPERIMENTAL)
- NEW: Added "tee" command.

- NEW: Enabled new Dual WAN support from Asus
- FIXED: no-ip DDNS entry would revert to Asus DDNS on webui
3.0.0.3.130.8 (8-June-2012):
*** Reverting to factory defaults BEFORE and AFTER flashing
this version is strongly recommended!
The newer Asus code base
seems to have changed quite a few settings, so you'll want to
not only start with the new default values, but also get rid
of obsolete settings.
Otherwise you will be wasting a
good amount of the limited available nvram. ***
- KNOWN ISSUE: Memory leak when using IPv6 (bug in Asus's code
and/or kernel code)
- KNOWN ISSUE: PPTP VPN can randomly reboot the router if accessing
a LAN device behind the router.
Workaround is to
use an IP range outside of the local LAN
(i.e. 10.0.0.0 instead of 192.168.1.0), and either
set your VPN to use the VPN tunnel as default
gateway, or manually add a route to your VPN
client.
- NEW: Rebased patches on 3.0.0.4.130 (RT-N53U sources).
Build 130 brings various code changes to IPv6, not sure
what else (as I have no changelog between 112 and 130).
The QoS code remains from build 108, as build 130 is
unstable.
- NEW: Added "diff" utility
- NEW: Keyword-based filter (new in 130)
- FIXED: Firmware/settings can now be uploaded over HTTPS
(bug fixed by Asus)
- FIXED: Buffer overflow in networkmap that would cause garbled

Asus's code)
- FIXED: Firewall would break when applying a game preset that
had multiple ports separated by a "," (bug in Asus's
code)
- FIXED: WOL through webui wasn't working when IPv6 is enabled
- FIXED: Memory leak in sit.ko (backported from Linux 2.6.25.3)
- IMPROVED: /jffs/scripts/ will be created automatically if it
doesn't exist (you must still make any new script
executable using "chmod a+rx script_filename")
3.0.0.3.108.7 (27-May-2012):
- NEW: Added no-ip.com support to DDNS (patch submitted by Igor Pavlov)

Shantanu Goel)
- NEW: Allows tweaking TCP/UDP connection tracking timeouts
- FIXED: Removed check in Asus's code that would reject txpower > 80
unless you clicked three times on Apply (?!).
NOTE: Still not sure power setting even works, as I get
-80db from the other end of the house no matter if I use
40 or 500 mW.

Behöver bara vara just FTP-serverprogrammet självt som loggar om man är intresserad av FTP inloggningskonton. Är man bara intresserad av IP för besökare så kan det lika gärna loggas av brandvägg.

Ta bort "https" för att se!
Edit: Kopiera direkt från "förvarningslänken" utan att ta med "https://", annars försvinner semikolon efter ftp om man klickar direkt. Klippa o klistra sen i webbläsaren.

Att surfa på någons öppna trådlösa nätverk är lagligt enligt ftp://ftp.idg.se/pfa/extramaterial/pdf/076PFA0604.pdf. Förresten, ni som tror att det är olagligt att kolla en öppen FTP, akta er för att klicka på länken, den leder nämligen till en öppen FTP.
Det är däremot rentutsagt förjävligt av ASUS att släppa en produkt som har en så pass korkad förvald inställning. Någon drabbad borde kräva skadestånd kan man tycka.

Ok jag har en RT-N56U och har inte haft nån usb-disk inkopplad på några månader. Går igenom inställningarna i routern och ser att FTP står som aktiverad men att jag inte har något ftp-konto (har aldrig skapat något) det står inget konto under ftp-inställningarna. Jag avaktiverar FTP helt under fliken aidisk. Jag avaktiverar även medietjänst vad nu det är för något.

Jag är inte helt säker men jag tror även att det är såhär: FTP:n har väl indexerats vid ett tidigare datum som står när man får upp sökträffen. Jag TROR att det är så att sökresultaten visar att vid just det angedda datumet var FTP:n öppen, alla datum som kommer efter indexeringsdatumet bör då rimligtvis kunna vara datum då användaren säkrat upp systemet. Detta är som sagt ett rimligt antagande och ingen direkt sanning.
Sen kan det ju bara vara precis som ovan nämner också, att det är för hög...

Tjena!
Vill börja med att tipsa dig som ovanstående också skrivit att du skall använda ett VPN då det du gör är ett brott och räknas som data intrång så tänk på det innan du börjar snoka runt.
Men annars används vilket FTP program som helst, till exempel FileZilla.
Men som sagt, tänk på att alltid använda kondom och skydda dig först!

Det beror helt på vad du gör med bilderna. Lägger du ut dem på facebook så att det skadar personen på bildens rykte är det säkert straffbart, men att bara gå in och titta på dem på en öppen FTP är det knappast.

Что мне делать, чтобы достучаться до айпишника с других сетей? Может какой-то сервис на роутере можно запустить? Роутер Asus N-66U.

Если твой роутер поддерживает туннелирование - попробуй построить туннель куда-нибудь в мир, за пределы неВоли.

подсказка: в меню роутеров и другого мыльничного оборудования это может называться keep-alive.

Vanochtend even gechecked en de mail en webhosting zijn prima. Ik kan echter opeens niet meer connecten met de FTP-server.
Test ik het echter vanaf m'n werk, dan werkt het wel. Ik heb gechecked en de FTP resolved naar hetzelfde IP-adres. Vanaf thuis kan ik de FTP ook prima pingen en een traceroute toont ook netjes dat 'ie uitkomt bij Hosting.eu
Echter, elke keer als ik wil connecten met Filezilla of de commandprompt tool FTP dan krijg ik gewoon een time-out. Dat terwijl er aan de PC of het netwerk thuis niets is veranderd tijdens of na de verhuizing van het domein...
Firewall heb ik al even uitgezet, maakte geen verschil. Virusscanner (BitDefender) ook even uitgezet, ook geen verschil.
Ik draai Windows 8.1 Professional, volledig up-to-date. Ook de nieuwe FileZilla software die gisteren (of was het nou vandaag) op Tweakers.net al voorbij kwam. Router is een ASUS RT-N66U met de Merlin firmware (ook de meest recente). Ziggo internet btw.

Ik kan verder prima FTP'en naar andere servers, maar niet naar jullie. Ik heb ook nog een ander domein bij jullie, daar kan ik ook niet meer naar FTP'en -- en dat heeft in het verleden zeer zeker wel gewerkt!
DM Is verstuurd. Hopelijk komen we eruit wat er aan de hand is, want het probleem lijkt na nadere diagnose toch echt extern te zitten (want anders had ik ook niet naar andere FTP-servers kunnen FTP'en, maar bv. ftp.adobe.com kan ik probleemloos op komen).
-- Edit: een IP-blokkade zou trouwens kunnen bedacht ik me zojuist, mijn bewakingscamera upload naar FTP en die heeft vannacht waarschijnlijk meerdere malen vruchteloos proberen te FTP'en.
