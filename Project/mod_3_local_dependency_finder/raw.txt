Port Forwarding ASUS RT-N66U for your NVR RecorderPort Forwarding ASUS RT-N66U for your NVR RecorderApril 4, 2016 by Matthew Rossi.Port forwarding is essential to viewing your surveillance system remotely. Without redirecting your packets you'll be stuck timing out every time you try to view your feed from a remote network. We try to make this process as simple for our end users as possible. I remember the first time I attempted to forward ports in 2005. It took me a few hours. I had a grasp on the idea, but not the concepts behind it, nor did I fully understand networking at the time. So, I sympathize with you attempting to do this on your own. Therefore, I'm making another port forwarding article in order to help anyone with this device view their cameras feed remotely. This router is one that we recommend for our IP systems. It has a strong processor and is capable of the bandwidth needed to transmit high-quality video. It'll even handle wireless applications well. If you've already read Port Forwarding for your Security DVR and NVR then you already have the information needed from your DVR/NVR. Let's get started.Configuring the RouterStep 1: Access Your RouterEnter the address of your router into your browsers URL bar. The default address is: 192.168.1.1 You should be prompted for a username and password.
The default username and passwords are listed above.Step 2: Navigate to Port Forwarding
After logging into your router you should be placed at a page that looks like this. Select WAN on the left hand side. Now select the Virtual Server / Port Forwarding tab on the top. You will be brought to a page like this. Our port forwarding rules are already in place in this image.Step 3: Create the RulesNow that we're in the right spot it's time to create our port forwarding rules so the DVR/NVR can send the camera feed to the outside world. Make sure port forwarding is enabled. If it's not enabled and you're able to create rules, they won't take effect.Here you will create a rule for each of the ports that you want to be opened.Start by giving the first rule a meaningful name.We chose "NVR 80," signifying the device and the port number.Now enter the port number underneath Port Range.Then enter the IP address of the NVR/DVR.After that enter the port number again.Now select the TCP dropdown box.Click the + symbol to the right.Repeat these steps for each port.Click apply.
The fields should look similar to this. The default IP and ports are as follows: Default IP address: 192.168.1.108 Default Data Port: 37777 Default HTTP Port: 80 The rules are now in place. Let's move on to the next step.Check Your WorkWe want to make sure that we aren't missing something and the router is open on the ports that we created rules for.Go to https://www.grc.com/shieldsupClick on the button labeled "Proceed"Enter the port numbers separated by a comma in the text field Click on "User Specified Custom Port Probe" They should display as "OPEN!". If they don't, go back and take a look at the rules. If you still can't figure it out, contact your ISP for support.In order to view your cameras remotely you'll need to have a constant pointer from the outside world back to your home network. Unless you pay for a static IP address you'll need a way to point to the network when your IP changes after the lease is up. What we use is DDNS. For instructions on configuring DDNS on your own follow this link:Configuring DDNS for Remote DVR ViewingIf you have finished port forwarding and DDNS and need help accessing your DVR/NVR click HERE for a helpful guide.Tagged in networking, port forwarding.Matt Rossi is a Technical Support Manager at CCTV Camera World, a leading CCTV Camera distributor located in Buffalo, NY.

How to Install VPN (Client) on Your Router
July 23, 2017
There are many reasons to install VPN on your home router. First, running VPN on your home router provides a layer of protection to all devices on your network so you don’t need to set up VPN on each device. Second, Apple TV, Fire TV and other media players generally don’t allow you to install VPN on them, so running VPN on your router is often the best option to access restricted content. Finally, most VPN providers allow only three concurrent connections. By installing VPN on your router instead of each device you bypass this limitation. In this article I’ll show you how to set up an OpenVPN client on an Asus router running Asuswrt-Merlin firmware. (If you want to read my upcoming article about setting up VPN on dd-wrt routers be sure to sign up for my newsletter.)
I use an Asus RT-AC68R, which is hands down one of the best (VPN) routers on the market. Before we set up the OpenVPN client let’s first replace the router’s firmware with the awesome “Asuswrt-Merlin” version. This custom-built firmware offers advanced VPN features that let you configure up to five OpenVPN clients and also offers a “Routing Policy” feature to specify which devices can use VPN and which can’t, a true pro level function. To download the latest Asuswrt-Merlin firmware and instructions click here. Backup your existing settings before installing the new firmware.
Below you’ll find instructions to configure OpenVPN clients for IPVanish, PIA, Torguard, HideMyAss , AirVPN, and proXPN.
Instructions
First, download and save the OpenVPN configuration files (.ovpn) from the VPN provider’s website. Some providers (HideMyAss) offer separate configuration files for  connections using TCP or UDP protocols. I almost always use UDP. The difference between UDP and TCP is minor. Here are the links to each provider’s OpenVPN configuration files.
prevnextIPVanishPrivate Internet AccessTorGuardHideMyAssCyberGhostAirVPNproXPNDownload IPVanish OpenVPN client settings.
You need to download two files:
Download Private Internet Access OpenVPN client settings.
Download the Certificate Authority file.
Download TorGuard OpenVPN client settings.
Download HideMyAss OpenVPN client settings.
Log in to your CyberGhost account. Next, follow the instructions here to generate your login credentials. Finally, download the OpenVPN configuration files.
First, log in to the AirVPN Client Area. Click Config Generator to load the OpenVPN Configuration Generator. Follow the instructions to generate and download your configuration file. Next, on the router, simply import the OpenVPN file you downloaded and click Apply.That's it. You can skip the rest of the instructions.
First, download the proXPN OpenVPN configuration file: proxpn.ovpn. This file includes all the default settings you need. Second, go to the proXPN server location page, choose an OpenVPN server, and then copy its IP address. Next, edit proxpn.ovpn in a text editor; replace the IP address on the first line with the IP address you copied from the location page. Then, on the router, import the edited proxpn.ovpn file. Finally, next to Redirect Internet traffic, choose "All traffic" and click Apply. That's it. You can skip the rest of the instructions.
Open a web browser and enter the IP address of the router.  Once logged in successfully you’ll see the Administrative page, as shown in Figure 1-1. Navigate to Advanced Settings and select VPN > OpenVPN Clients.
Figure 1-1
Client Control
Underneath the Client control section, right next to the Select client instance option, choose a VPN client instance from the drop down list.
Next, click Choose File, select a configuration file you downloaded earlier, and click Upload. This applies the default settings for you.
Next, we’ll go through and fine-tune each setting. Let’s start with changes to the Basic Settings.
Basic Settings
Start with WAN: Select Yes if you want the VPN to start automatically when the router boots; select No if you want to manually start the VPN.
Interface Type: TUN
Protocol: This setting is pre-selected by the file you imported.
Firewall: Automatic
Server Address and Port: The “Address” and “Port” fields are pre-selected by the file you imported.
Authorization Mode: TLS
Username/Password Authentication: Yes
Username: Fill in the username of your VPN account
Password: Fill in the password of your VPN account
Extra HMAC authorization: Disabled
Create NAT on tunnel: Yes
Advanced Settings
Poll Interval: 0
Accept DNS Configuration: Choose Strict to use the provider’s DNS settings; choose Disabled to not use the provider’s DNS settings.
Encryption cipher: Default
Compression: Adaptive
TLS Renegotiation Time: -1
Connection Retry: -1
Verify Server Certificate: No
Redirect Internet traffic: No.  Using the “Policy rules” option allows you to specify which devices connect to the Internet through VPN, and which devices connect directly.

Next, go to the folder containing the OpenVPN configuration files you downloaded earlier. Open the key and certificate files using a text editor. Copy and paste the entire contents of each file into its corresponding text box in Figure 1-2. prevnextIPVanishPrivate Internet AccessTorGuardHideMyAssCyberGhostOpen ca.ipvanish.com.crt.

Open client.crt. Copy and paste its contents into the Client Certificate text box.
Open client.key. Copy and paste its contents into the Client Key text box.
Click the Apply button.
Return to the Client control section and make sure the Service state is switched to ON.
Now verify your VPN client status by navigating to VPN > VPN Status, as shown in Figure 1-3.

By setting up VPN on your router you’ve added an extra layer of protection for devices connected to your home network. I appreciate all the wonderful feedback. Keep commenting, your support makes this site better!
Q & A
Fix for the “routing conflict” error
Nov 13, 2015
A couple of readers said they got a “routing conflict” after they made changes to the VPN settings. After testing this issue with IPVanish, PIA and Torguard it seems this problem is exclusive to IPVanish.
When disconnecting from the IPVanish server the remote IP address assigned to the router’s WAN interface should be removed automatically, but it isn’t. This causes the “routing conflict” error when you re-connect by toggling the “service state” button, or by clicking the “apply” button. This error shouldn’t interfere with your VPN connection, but it does mess up routing tables, and it’s annoying. I have submitted this issue to Erich – Asuswrt-Merlin FW developer, and IPVanish. I’m hoping to see an official solution soon.
Until there is a solution to this problem you can temporarily fix the “routing conflict” by manually removing the route that should’ve been automatically removed by the VPN server when it disconnected. This manual fix is required each time you disconnect from the VPN server, or after you make changes to the router settings. Here are my brief instructions:
Log into the router using SSH
ssh 192.168.1.1
Delete the route associated with the VPN server as shown below (s.s.s.s is the IP address of the VPN server).
ip route delete s.s.s.s

Hi,
Great article, do you please have instructions/settings for Pure VPN by any chance, I have a Asus RT-AC68U router with AsusWRT Merlin Firmware and would like to setup for Pure VPN.
I have played around with this for some days and got it working once , but the speed was very low, and I can’t even replicate this now.
I seem to get to 2 scenarios: 1. can’t connect or 2. connects(or so the router says) but won’t connect to any site on any of my browsers.
Thank you

Hi, I have three routers, is there any alternate firmware I could use on either that would enable VPN use ? Routers are OVISLINK WLA-5000A, other is a Sagemcom 2764gv and the last one is a Dlink DIR-618, can I use any of them for VPN with an alternate Firmware ?

I’m trying to configure my home RT-AC66U (running Merlin firmware) so that only Asus’s router embedded DownloadMaster uses PIA, and all other wired/wirless devices using the router do not use the VPN.
I’ve got PIA up and running, but all traffic uses the VPN which is problematic for our work computers that must connect with corporate VPN’s (we work from home).
Thanks for your superb information, and in advance for your suggestion(s) on how to make this work.

Hello. I am a networking noob and can’t seem to get this to work. The green switch is on at the end but it will not connect to IPVanish, it just keeps clocking. Any suggestions?

Thank you very much for the instructions! Running an Asus router with AsusWRT-Merlin (latest version as of writing this) and your instructions for connecting it to Ipvansih are spot on! Setting all the traffic leaving my router to use the vpn rather then having to set up each and every machine in my house, (voip box, internet connected printer, appletv box, laptop, ipad, iphone, Kodi box, etc.) is a royal pain, not to mention that most of them don’t even support setting up a VPN! Those that do are difficult at best to configure and get to work! I also offer free wifi connections to people visiting, on a separated ssid of course, and by having the router itself connected to my vpn provider, I can protect them as well!
This is one of the reasons I support large companies that allow for third party firmware on their devices. Asus has been a big supporter of open source firmware on their routers and the community hasn’t disappointed. Both is supplying working firmware, thanks AsusWRT-Merlin, and thank you for the documentation on how to connect everything!

I have read this, but somehow cannot get it to work on my ASUS RT-AC68U
with standard ASUS firmware. I want to be able to connect to my router/LAN via OpenVPN from a hotel room 1,000 miles away so I can use Microsoft Remote Desktop via VPN to connect to one of the computers on the LAN.
I enabled OpenVPN and created a Username/Password and downloaded the config file. Then, I went to the VPN Client tab and created and activated a VPN Client (not sure why … is this for my laptop in the remote hotel room?). It asked for the VPN Server config file during the process.
Now that both the VPN Server is created and a VPN client is activated, what do I do with my laptop to access the router/LAN via VPN?
Thanks.

I just went through both your tutorials for setting up a 2nd router with VPN and this one. I am using PIA and an Asus RT-N12D1 with Asuswrt-Merlin firmware loaded. I am able to follow all the steps in you guides successfully, but after I set up all the settings on the OpenVPN client page (the .ovpn file, username & pw, and paste the certificate authority) and click apply. I then switch the service state to On and it wont connect. The VPNrouter has internet access and is plugged into another router that is plugged into a cable modem.
When I look at the router logs I am seeing this error “openvpn[436]: ERROR: username from Auth authfile ‘up’ is empty”.
Any ideas what the problem is and how to fix it? It sounds like it is not reading my username or something, but I have made sure I am putting in the correct username and PW for my PIA account.
Thanks for the guides.

Hi,
First, I would like to say thank you very much sharing the knowledge of setting up VPN.
You did a superb job educating me the importance of VPN and with your instructions are easy to follow and to understand.
I have question….. currently, I have proXPN as my VPN service.
I would to know if I can use your setup with proXPN.
If you do know how, would you mind help me to setup?
I’m having a hard of getting the openVPN list.
Thank you, and I will do my best to pass down your site to other people that I know who would like to setup a VPN on their routers.

I’m having issues with the Routing conflict and am unable to SSH to my router.
I am using Putty on my laptop and trying to SSH to my VPN router IP address.
The laptop can connect as I have the router Admin page open on it.
Any help connecting so that I can delete the route .
Also in my VPN router when the
VPN is turned off I have a TX rate to my fire stick of 30Mbps however when I turn on the IPVanish VPN it goes down to 6 which in turn is causing me all kinds of buffering issues….any advice.

My basic question is now that I have my VPN router configured using one of the IPVanish

I am guessing that I do not need to run the IPVanish software on my desktop/internet router any more.

Each .ovpn file corresponds to a specific location. You get better speeds by choosing one that is closer to your actual location. However, if you plan to use VPN to bypass geo-blocking, choose the location where you want to appear to be.

For some reason the torguard OPVN files won’t work but your customer configuration does.
I tried to nail down the differences and found:
client
dev tun
proto udp
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
ca ca.crt
auth-user-pass
comp-lzo
These were the only things different however
I could never connect when these lines were added to the configuration.
Strange.

I’ve got my VPN client running on my RT-N66, but now how do I see my server behind it?
I can get the VPN’s IP address via whatsmyip services or DDNS. I am able to access the FTP server for the flash drive on my router, so it doesn’t look like my VPN provider is all the ports, but except for the FTP server on the router itself, I cannot see anything else. And yes, I have port forwarding set up properly- I am able to see that server without the VPN client running.
On the off chance that my VPN provider is blocking some ports, I’ll set the FTP to a different port and set the server to the old FTP port (21), but assuming that’s not the problem then what should I do?
Would changing my policy rules allow incoming connections from my ISP to get routed correctly? I guess that’s something else I could try. Nonetheless, I’d prefer to have my server accessible via the VPN and not through my ISP.

MarkJanuary 20, 2016 at 3:59 pm
Thanks for the great tutorial.
I am not well skilled in these things but the tutorial was great!
One question I had was once I have IPVanish installed on the router, is there a way to have it search for the fastest connection or just use US IP addresses since I am in the US?
I ask because I have been on an IP address in Albania for 2 days and it sometimes slows to a crawl?
Thanks!
Also for some reason I can’t access the router with Putty on port 22.
I did receive a connection conflict yesterday but all is well today so far.

Quebecois_StiJanuary 11, 2016 at 11:44 am
It is not working yet.
I contacted their help support. They said it was better to try with the IP address directly instead of hostname and to try few differents port, those below:
I’ve tried 209.95.50.87 (New York server)
with each one of those:
UDP 9201, 1194, 8080, 53
TCP 80, 110, 443
still getting same error, as:
for UDP: openvpn[8046]: write UDPv4: Network is unreachable (code=101)
for TCP: openvpn[8108]: TCP: connect to [AF_INET]209.95.50.87:80 failed, will try again in 5 seconds: Network is unreachable
Now they said I need to try each IP address linked to the hostname with port too… there are 13 of them… + combination with the port number. will take some time to do it.
I am wondering, maybe it’s a network problem on my side that I have. My router connected to my computer is connected to another one, I don’t know if it can make trouble ? So right now: modem => router 1 in WAN port => LAN port of router 1 => LAN port of router 2. I am no expert in network maybe this way to do it is not good. You may wonder why I have two router… I got a router in one building (the one that have the modem) and another one in another building.
I tried their Windows little software to connect to the VPN, it works correctly. I wanted to make the router works because it would be less painfull with other connected devices and even those not supported by app or something.
Thanks for support.

I noticed this was updated 01/08/16 but I did not see a change in any of the steps.
Also, after applying these to my
router, (RT-AC68U) it would work initially, but the speeds are dramatically slower, and after a day or so, it drops my connection.
I would then have to go back in to service state and turn it back off to gain connection.
Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?

Hi. I’m trying to set up two routers to VPN one of them using your guide at https://vpntips.com/how-to-unblock-any-digital-media-player/
I think I got through most of it (aside from #6 Under the “Administration” menu, enable the “Allow web access from WAN” – I don’t see this option anywhere), but setting up the VPN on the TP-LINK TL-WDR3600 Wireless N600 Dual Band Router you recommended has me baffled. I have no technical knowledge of these things and I can’t find anything online. I’ll be using a Linksys E2500 as the internet router and the TPLink as the VPN router. I’m stuck at step 2 on this guide. I don’t see anything labelled VPN in this TP Link routers settings.

Hi Shawn,
You can find the settings for OpenVPN under Services > VPN provided that you've replaced the router’s firmware with the dd-wrt firmware for TP-LINK TL-WDR3600. On a dd-wrt router, the settings for the OpenVPN client look similar to this.

Strange issue.
When I unboxed the router, I had to go to 192.168.0.1 to get into the settings.
After using your other guide, and changing the settings, I then had to go to 10.0.0.1 to get into the settings. Now, after updating the firmware one of the ones you linked here (one didn’t do anything, the other updated successfully, but I can tell which is which now), I can’t log into the router settings at either of those addresses anymore. I just get blank “webpage is not available” pages.

I finally figured out what was up with the firmware issue and not being able to get into the router settings. I’m still stuck in a couple places. Step 6 from the other guide I referenced earlier regarding going to Administration and “allowing web access from WAN” – I still don’t see this option in the new firmware either.
And I’m still stuck on step 2 here. I don’t see anything about VPNs in the advanced settings. I screenshotted the only thing I could find regarding VPNs.

Hi philmiami,
Setting up PrivateTunnel on the router is easy. First, download your OpenVPN profile from PrivateTunnel. Next, on the router simply import the OpenVPN profile you downloaded then click Apply. That’s all you have to do. Check your IP address here. To see your VPN client status, go to VPN > VPN Status. Wait a few seconds then hit Refresh button a couple of times if there is no data.

Im working on trying to get the PIA VPN up and running on an Asus RT-68R running Merlin Firmware 378.56.2.
The Basic WAN settings are mostly default with the exception of UPnP being active and selecting my own DNS servers as opposed to those supplied by the ISP.

Hi William
I updated my router with the Asuswrt-Merlin software and followed your instructions in setting up an OpenVPN client using my ipvanish account. On initial setup it worked fine however when I switched the ‘Service state’ from on to off and then on again, a message pops up saying ‘Error – Router conflict! The same message appears when I change the ‘redirect internet traffic’ from All traffic to No. The only way that I can reconnect back to my OpenVPN client is by resetting the modem which is very frustrating.
The reason I switch from VPN to standard ISP connection is that I don’t want certain devices in my home using the VPN and also using the VPN slows down the internet as I have a standard DSL connection.
I reside in Australia and recently have purchased a Roku 4 to test my VPN however will not be able to if my router VPN keeps dropping off.
I am also having problems with my wifi on my HTC one M7 (Android Phone) when my VPN option is switched on in my router. All other devices seem to work well. The phone connects to my wifi signals both (2.4 and 5 ghz) however does not connect to the net or anything online. Why is it doing that?
My router is a RT-AC68U and internet provided via a DSL modem.
Please help 🙁
Thanks

Glad you brought that up Lal -as I just setup IPVanish on the same router (RT-AC68U connected with an external DSL modem) – setup went through perfectly due to the excellent guide on this site and all of my devices function well – the only problem I’m having is the same as yours – if I turn off “redirect internet traffic” (to compare speeds etc) then when I switch it back to all, the router will not connect to the VPN again without a reboot.
I am currently on Merlin’s latest 378.56_2 stable firmware and have no other problems aside from this – I can live with it but it’s also picking threads out of my normally passive OCD 😉

Guys, thanks for the heads-up. I’ve added the solution to the routing conflict problem you experienced in the new Q & A section at the end of the article. Let me know how it goes.

I also am a newbie not just on vpn but on networking as well.
However I try to muddle along.
I was running ipVanish on individual computers.
I have now installed it , using your wonderful clear instructions, on my RT AC87U router.
I have internet access on the router, VPN client is running as shown, and I can get on the internet on all computers except the Windows 10 one that I used to install on the router.
I keep getting the message that my DNS settings are wrong.
Does anyone know how to resolve this problem?
Should I uninstall ipVanish from this computer?
New question.
Can I hook up more than 1 router to my modem?
I have several routers including an RT AC68U. My modem has 4 ports so it seems to me I should be able to hook up 4 routers but I don’t know if I can. If possible, I would like a second one that will be less accessible by others in the office.
Thanks for any help

Hi Bill,
Glad to know you managed to install VPN on your router following my guide 🙂
You no longer need to keep the IP Vanish VPN on the Windows machine since VPN now runs on the router. It tunnels the traffic from all devices in your home network.
Yes, you can connect more than 1 router to your modem. How to exactly configure each router so it won’t conflict with others depends on what you’re trying to accomplish, and the capabilities of your modem. Which modem do you use?

My Raspberry Pi is wired to my router. Is there anyway I can set this to only VPN via wired and leave my wifi as normal?
Or better yet just simply install IP Vanish directly on the raspberry pi running osmc so nothing is affected

William C.September 1, 2015 at 2:21 pm
Hi Joe,
The easiest approach for you would be to install the IP Vanish VPN on your Raspberry Pi. You need to run a shell script which shapes the traffic using firewall rules if you want to tunnel only specific clients through the VPN connection on the router. I am working on a guide that shows how this can be done. Make sure you subscribe to my newsletter to be notified when it’s complete.

What if I would like to install the client on 3 different laptops, but each of them should have their own private key. How do I send pub key for each client to the router?

Hi Michael! We checked with the developer of the Asuswrt-Merlin firmware; unfortunately, it doesn’t support more than 2 Openvpn profiles.

Having trouble getting the PIA config to apply on my ASUS WRT-N10P after inputting all of the required information manually or loaded from a .opvn file provided by PIA. Once I apply the settings, it refreshes and doesn’t save anything that was filled in. I have done a factory and settings reset, but still continues. Any ideas?

Ditto Grant & rob m – I too see the same issue on RT-N10P where it doesn’t appear that the VPN settings completely save. After hitting Apply the PIA username and password disappear. Also the certificate authority disappears (sometimes). Also the custom configuration keeps disappearing.
I tried uploading the *.opvn files from PIA. It looks like some of those settings tend to “stick” like user address and the custom configuration, but others do not (username, password, redirect traffic, etc.)
Using latest firmware (pre-mod 8-2).
I will need to flash Tomato soon if I can’t get this resolved.

Hi William,
I couldn’t figure out how to do it that way, what I did instead was I set my laptop a static IP address via the router, and then redirected all VPN traffic using a polciy rule to the source IP of my laptop.
Seems to be working fine now.. will let you know how I go still testing things out with this puppy! Thanks for your help!

Hi there,
I want to set up my open VPN (I’m using private internet access) to where it is ONLY connected to one port on my router.
So, I have 4 ethernet ports, and for example, I only want port 1 to have access to the VPN, so when I plug in my laptop to port 1 it will be running off the VPN connection only.
Is this possible to do with the merlin firmware?
Obviously I don’t want the wireless to be connected to the VPN or any other connections to my router, just port 1.. please let me know 🙂

Thomas,
You can try using iptables to allow device that’s connected to port 1 interface to use VPN exclusively. Alternatively, you can try the two routers setup.

I see you are using Merlin. In previous comments you stated that this will work on the RT-AC87R/U also. However, I have the AC87R and the configuration screens are very different then what you show. I follow the config as close as possible (login creds, server name, load config file for server in question and add the hash. ) The stock firmware (Non-DD-WRT nor Merlin, updated to 3.0.0.4.378_6117) shows the VPN up and connected however, the IP reporting back to me is the same as non-VPN IP (Using your site or IPCow).

Hi
I just did this and I just have one question…shouldnt the WAN IP, under Network Map, change? The OVPN is active but the IP-adress is the same as with the OVPN deactivated.
PostAuthor Reply
William C.April 24, 2015 at 11:20 am
Hi,
VPN doesn’t change your WAN IP, it simply masquerades it. Every time you connect to the Internet, a public IP is assigned to your router by the ISP. This IP address is your WAN IP and it’s used by your router to communicate with other devices on the Internet. As soon as the VPN starts running, it creates a private network interconnecting your router and the VPN server;
future communications are carried through this private network, using your existing Internet connection.

PEApril 24, 2015 at 12:02 pm
Thx for answering! I suspected as much.
I’m a newbe to this VPN-thing…is there a way to check the IP provided by the VPN? Just wanna be sure in these piracyhunting days…

RoyApril 30, 2015 at 3:05 pm
For a quick audit of what info your browser is sharing with websites, check out http://ipleak.net/ . If you go there while on a VPN, the IP address provided by your VPN will be shown at the top of the page.
That site will also allow you to test what IP your torrent client is exposing to the public.
For a more complete browser privacy audit, try http://www.browserleaks.com/

Message to Ben.
Yes, you can install IPVanish on a DSL-AC68U.
I have just installed it on a DSL-AC68R:
1) Go to IPVanish software support site and download two files:
a) Certificate file: ca.ipvanish.com.crt
b) openVPN file for the server you are planning to use, eg. ipvanish-US-LAX-a01.ovpn
2) On your modem, go to VPN, VPN Client, Add Profile.
3) Enter any name, your login details and load the ovpn file.
4) Select to upload the certificate and upload the .crt file
5) Click Save and Activate.
That should be it
🙂

Hi Ben:
I don’t think you can install IPVanish client on your modem-router. As far as I know there isn’t any firmware that supports OpenVPN client for DSL-AC68U. To setup IPVanish on a router, get a second (VPN) router that has firmware to support the OpenVPN client, and connect it to DSL-AC68U. My latest article explains how you can set this up and lists some compatible routers. I recommend you give the two-router setup a try.

To install IPVanish on your RT-AC66U router, first download and install the Asuswrt-Merlin firmware. Then, simply follow the instructions in the article.

Great read! I am a VPN newbie who just signed up for IP Vanish. I have a Netgear WNR 3500 running DD-WRT v24-sp2 (8/12/10) mega. It supports open VPN; however, the DD-WRT configuration instructions provided by IP Vanish do not match up with the settings available on my router. Any advice on where I could begin to educate myself on how to configure my router? Alternatively, I am considering purchasing an ASUS RT-AC66R and loading with DD-WRT. IP Vanish sells this model on its website, pre-loaded with DD-WRT. I am assuming I could load the same version of DD-WRT on one purchased elsewhere and configure it using their guide. I appreciate any feedback. Thanks

How can I make specific devices use ipvanish’s VPN which others devices default to non-VPN?
PostAuthor Reply
William C. DavisFebruary 26, 2015 at 8:17 pm
You can set up firewall rules on the router using the “iptables” command and control which devices can use VPN. It’s a bit involved to explain how this works in the comment area. But I promise I will add this next time I update the article. Here is a basic outline of it works:
1. Enable SSH on the router.
2. SSH into the router and set up JFFS partition.
3. Create a script file that contains the firewall rules and defines the clients that can’t use VPN.
4. Run that script.

Your articles are very written for novices like myself. Thank you.
I would like to do the same thing as Robert asked (How can I make specific devices use IPVanish’s VPN which others devices default to non-VPN?). Would you be open to helping us with an step-by-step article showing how to do this with an ASUS RT-N66U router, running the latest Asuswrt-Merlin firmware? I do not have two routers but I do have a Roku3 and an Amazon Fire TV. These I would like to run on a wireless VPN tunnel connection and my home computers on my ISP’s standard connection.
Any assistance is greatly appreciated!

Hi David,
My next article will demonstrate how to selectively route traffic on Asus router to allow certain devices to use VPN, and others default to non-VPN. Make sure you subscribe to my newsletter to be notified when it’s complete.
DavidNovember 4, 2015 at 11:27 pm
Thanks!
I should clarify my request a bit. I have seen some fairly confusing posts elsewhere approaching the problem through exclusions to the VPN. For my needs ( a couple of Fire TVs running Kodi) I would think that approach would be inefficient as I have many more computers, iphones, ipads, etc that do not have fixed IP addresses. I was thinking that specifying the two Fire TV IP addresses (or even better their MAC addresses) that need to be routed through the IPVanish VPN would be more efficient and easier to maintain.
In addition, I would like to learn how to block outbound traffic from theses devices to specific domains to avoid unwanted software updates from taking place. It turns out that one of the domain names is 2 characters too long to block it from within the firmware UI (I suspect its a bug in the firmware UI).
I would be ever so grateful for one of your step-by-step tutorials on these two topics. I imagine there are many more folks who would be as well.
Again, thank you!

nodotFebruary 1, 2015 at 1:33 pm
Great question! If you install IPVanish on the router you protect all devices that use that router, because all outgoing connection are going through the secure tunnel to IPVanish’s VPN server.
You can also use the ASUS router as a VPN server for “incoming” connections, for example if you want to connect to your home network from a laptop while you are traveling. For that to work you need to install a VPN client on your laptop or mobile device (Tunnelblick for example) that will then connect to your ASUS router.
You should be able to run both at the same time, so if you wanted to access the Internet via your home router, it should still route your requests via IPVanish. However, if you already have an IPVanish subscription, it would certainly be faster to simply install IPVanish on your laptop or mobile and use it directly 😉

MichaelJanuary 31, 2015 at 10:23 pm
Just wondering why is it necessary to use IPVanish when the router supports its own OpenVPN server?
How would one set up OpenVPN on the server and client side?

February 23, 2013April 26, 2016Recovering ASUS router firmware without Windows
If you own an ASUS router and you brick it while trying to upgrade the firmware or some other action, you'll probably find documentation saying you need to run a Windows-only firmware restoration program to undo this damage.
While this is apparently the only officially supported method for restoring firmware (the alternative being to ship the router to ASUS for repair, a 10+ day process), I found with some exploring that the Windows program is likely just a glorified tftp client, and that you can restore firmware using some more standard, non-Windows tools.
I'm listing below the steps I had to use today after trying to upgrade my RT-AC66U device from firmware version 3.0.0.4.266 to 3.0.0.4.270.  (The release notes for the latter indicate a fix for a "live update related bug" which is what I suspect I encountered when I first tried to do the upgrade via the web GUI.)
I'm a Mac user, but these steps should work for other non-Windows operating systems such as Linux. It hopefully goes without saying that you should follow these steps at your own risk, and I make no claims or warranty about the outcome; you could end up worse off than you are now.  You could set your router on fire. You could end up killing another version of yourself living in an alternate universe.  Be careful.
1. Make sure your router is indeed in need of an emergency recovery firmware restore.  On the ASUS unit I have, this is indicated by a slowly flashing power light and a clear lack of Internet connectivity.  Make sure the other usual methods - power off, hold down the reset button, hold down the reset button as you power on, etc. - don't fix things.
2. Find a way to get a known good ASUS firmware image file onto your system.  This is probably a file that ends in ".trx" such as "RT-AC66U_3.0.0.4_270.trx".
3. Unplug all other network devices from the unit, and connect your Mac or other system to the ASUS unit with an Ethernet cable plugged in to port #1 on the router.
4. Setup your network configuration so that you have a static IP address on the 192.168.1.0/24 network block.  I used 192.168.1.10 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 and a gateway of 192.168.1.0.
5. Open a Terminal window and make sure you can ping 192.168.1.1., the probably IP address of the ASUS router.  If you can't ping the router, the rest of these steps probably won't work.
6. CD into the directory where the firmware image ending in .trx exists (see step #2 above).
7. Run these commands from the terminal prompt, using the correct firmware image filename in the "put" command:
$ tftp
tftp> connect
(to) 192.168.1.1
tftp> binary
tftp> put RT-AC66U_3.0.0.4_266.trx
Sent 22765568 bytes in 76.5 seconds
tftp> quit
8. Give the router about 5 minutes to process the firmware image you've just sent it.  I had to then manually turn the unit off and back on to get it to reboot into a working state.  Once it came back up, I could again ping it and I could again access the admin GUI via the web.
If that doesn't work, it wouldn't hurt to repeat the steps again and give it another try.  If that still doesn't work, you'll probably want to call ASUS for an RMA case (that's 812-282-2787 in the US and Canada).
I would have hoped that a company manufacturing devices for the modern age would not hobble their customers` ability to self-troubleshoot by limiting the recovery process to only users running Windows.  Even if the above method is unsupported, they could at least publish it in some form so that they don't use up their time and their customers` time with unnecessary interactions with Windows users, or worse, mailing units in for repair that could instead be repaired where they sit.
I hope these steps are helpful to someone else.  Let me know if you find other techniques that might help in similar situations. (If this post really got you out of a jam and you're feeling super thankful, consider donating Bitcoins.)

Thanks very much for this short tutorial.
Unfortunatley in then end I could not even ping the router, so I had to get an RMA and send it back.
They still make the best routers but need to improve on how firmware gets updated.

Appreciated since I know I'll hit this and it helps explain the random trx files sitting in the Downloads directory that I can now delete.
Cheers.

If you can't ping the router, then you could try using ARP to give you an IP address associated with the MAC of the device.
http://www.intel.com/support/netport/pro/sb/cs-015307.htm
Might not work with something like a router that already has an IP address.
Or else use wireshark to listen for any traffic at all over the wire to glean the IP address range. If you don't know it already.
If neither work, and you can't RMA, then there's always the possibility of using a BusPirate to write to the eeprom that the device is likely using. That depends on you getting access to a good firmware image somehow. Whether it's processing a downloaded file or copying from a known good device.

I had the same issue, and these instructions worked brilliantly, with one caveat: Even in rescue mode, my router used the same IP it had before it bricked, so I had to use that instead of 192.168.1.1.

You might need to type:
tftp> timeout XXX
Where XXX is the number of seconds before the upload times out. My default setting was 30, which wasn't long enough. 120 should be sufficient.

I also had to set my timeout to 120.
Actual time was 90 seconds. Also, if people can't ping their router, make sure it's not being blocked by a firewall; this was a stumbling block for me.

Thanks very, very much!
After spending too many time around my wife's WpC with no success, I've finaly managed to fix my Asus RT-N11 router with my Fedora 18!
My router was blinking fast the power led, and didn't appear to respond to reset!
It happened that it had it's IP was on 192.168.123.254!
1- Configured my ethernet to 192.168.123.222 with 255.255.255.0
2- Managed to ping the router in 192.168.123.254
3- Performed the command you did
4- Waited for about 5 minutes
5- Restarted the router
6- Performed a reset
7- Et voila! Access the web GUI in 192.168.1.1 with DHCP!!!

Nice usefull comments on this site. Did not help me though. After the cable company did some upgrades, my router became unresponsive. No IP-address and power light slowly flashing.
Connected it with a dedicated cat5e cable to the computer and listened to it using wireshark to see what the router was doing.
This turned out that is was doing nothing. Normally you can pickout an ipaddress this way but no luck. The only thing coming from the router was spanning tree requests.
???
Connected the internet port of the router to an other ac66u router's normal routing port. The lights started flashing and it came up with an ipaddress 192.168.2.1.
Connected with a browser to the router and set it up again.
Something strange though. I re-setted this device in all the ways I could find on the internet, also the 30-30-30 method. It did not work. When finally I could get in to the router, everything was still there. User, passwd and wireless information ... strange.

First...thank you. VERY very much.
Second, if the router subnet was changed (I changed mine from the default .1.1 to .0.1)...that's the same subnet you'll use for the procedure.

Thank you SO MUCH for this! This also worked flawlessly to flash the Shibby mod of TomatoUSB to my RT-N12/D1. Seeing as how all this is, is a tftp connection it seems rather silly that ASUS doesn't have a tool ready for all platforms.
For more info on TomatoUSB and Shibby's mod check out tomato.groov.pl. I really much prefer Tomato to ASUS's stock firmware.

Chris,
This was a perfect solution and worked exactly as advertised!
My ASUS RT-AC66R froze after a short power interruption and nothing i could do could get it restarted.
Luckily I came across your posting just before I was going to ship it back.
Thanks for not ignoring we Mac users!

This article is exactly what I've been looking for, however when I type the commands into terminal. Nothing seems to happen?
Do you type them one at a time? Do you get a response after typing each one?
When I type the first line, I get
-bash: $: command not found
when I type
tftp> connect
I get a cursor but no other response?
Any help appreciated

Simon,
You don't have the tftp program. You should get that first.
The tftp> part is the prompt from when you have that program open. At that prompt you type connect, rather than typing in "tftp> connect" to the bash prompt.

Hi,
I have the same problem but do not understand your reply James. Maybe because of my English or little clue about Terminal. How can I get tfpt program that runs in Terminal? 😮
Thanks a lot.
I may have bigger problem that my router has different ip since ping gaves me only timeout.

Thanks for the tutorial my friend! However, whenever I try to connect with my Asus WL500W I do get a connection via TFTP, but it drops after ~30s/1m. This in turn makes it quite hard to PUT the datafile, if I can hardly get it to binary mode. Let alone the possibility it might brick my router if the file doesn't get through.
Using Debian 7.2 wheezy running Linux kernel 3.2.0.4-amd64. Connected with my router through cat5e. No wifi, ofc.
After pulling power and replugging it, it boots in normal mode, without problems.
Goal: replace DD-WRT for Oleg's FW.
Any help is appreciated.
Kromme.

Great post and thanks!
I'm able to get to get a response when I ping the router, but then when I go in to TFTP the file, I kept getting timeouts.
So, I set the timeout to "6000" just to give it plenty of time, but no luck.
It just sits there.
It's been close to 10 minutes now and I'm not getting the "sent...." response.
Any ideas?

Just a spot of thanks for this. My router broke mid-update and was not responding to anything. Couldnt ping it @ 192.168.1.1 but thought I'd give your TFTP instructions anyway and the router came back with all its settings intact. Worked for both stock and also the alternative firmware I use.
Thanks a lot for posting !

Wow! It worked for me thanks! But with one modification. It failed first so I've installed Wireshark. And checked that it doing ARP requests for 192.168.1.11. So I've changed my IP from 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.11 and it worked. Thanks again!

Chris,
You are a genius.
I had spent many hours over a three day period trying to bring my Asus router back from the dead.
I could not accomplish this with the Asus router utility and Windows computers.
I had given the router up for lost.
But I followed your instructions and the router is back to life.
I bricked it in the first place trying to upgrade the tomato firmware on it.
I don't know if I have the courage to try again.
You really made my day!

Using your instructions I have successfully restored my "dead" Asus RT-N to its newest version of Asus firmware.
I would like to flash the router to Tomato firmware.
Could I just follow the same tftp instructions and substitute a tomato firmware compatible with my router into the tftp instructions and accomplish the flash that way?
I've seen some tutorials that basically seem to do that in a Windows environment.
I am running Mac OS X.
Thanks.

Tried your howto and everything seemed to work fine....but... when i rebooted the router it went back to recovery mode with the power light slowly flashing...
Still being able to ping the router i ran the process again, but still the same. When I try to reach the web interface it just gives me a sign which says (roughly translated)
"Settings have been updated, the website will update. Changes has been made on IP-adress or port. You will now be disconnected from RT-N66U. To access the settings of RT-N66U, reconnect the wifi and use the updated IP-adress or port."
Any idea about the updated ip-adress or port...? tried several different ip-adresses but none work except 192.168.1.1 and gives me the message above.
Thanks for a good howto anyway!

I initially received the same webpage message as you.
I followed the instructions again and, this time, waited a good 15 minutes before I rebooted.
This seemed to do the trick as the router rebooted normally and I could access the router GUI.
Give it a shot and best of luck!

Thank you!
I was having trouble getting my connection between OS X and Win7 though parallels to play nice.
I wish I had found this before wasting time downloading and install their utility.

By the way... This tftp method works great to install the TomatoUSB firmware.
I had to reset the NVRAM (power off, hold WPS button, power on, wait 30 seconds, release WPS button) and let the router reboot a couple of times.
After that 5GHz was disabled.
I needed to go into Tomato's Web Interface, reset NVRAM from there, and then reboot again (without changing any settings).
Now it is all good.

Hey there, awesome guide! Can you please help with the network config part in Ubuntu? I drop eth0, then restart it with: (my router is .29.1)
ifconfig eth0 192.168.29.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
route add default gw 192.168.29.0
Then when I run the tftp commands it just times out on put, even with 8 minute timeout. I can ping 192.168.29.1 and get a response, though. Thanks!

Worked like a dream on my RT-N66U after Asus's automatic update via the web browser borked the box.
(OSX 10.10.4)
Had to force it into recovery mode with a 5 second reset push, but after that your tftp insight was straightforward to execute.
And my settings remained intact too, which I wasn't expecting. It rebooted from net 1 into my regular LAN subnet and all was well.
Thanks!

Your post saved my night.
Accidentally flashed my rt-ac68u to dd-wrt instead of latest Asus flash by grabbing wrong file.
renaming to trx to bin didn't work, ASUS recovery tool did nothing.
I ended up installing TFTP in Windows (features and such under programs) and using that tool to upload the trx following your instructions.
Worked like a charm. (forgot my lan adapter at the office for my macbook)

Just saved me £80, thank you so much! I would just like to add, if you find the router is returning to recovery mode every time, wait at least 20 minutes after completing the push command before restarting the router. Before you turn the router back on, hold the wps button then turn it on and keep the wps button held in for 30 seconds.

I tried resetting the router maaaany times and noticed my cable connection was active just a minute or so, when pinging the router, before losing the connection to the router.
Once the ping was OK I started
a tftp software I found (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html) which worked like a charm (I couldn't get the installed tftp work in terminal mode).
Spent 4-5 hours on this and your instruction made it work in the end!

I don't know when this became available, but Asus now has a firmware restoration app available on the Mac App Store:
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asus-firmware-restoration/id1020519014?mt=12
I tried following the instructions from this post, and it didn't work for me. However, the Asus Firmware Restoration app worked fine, and I used it to upgrade my router to asuswrt-merlin (the built-in firmware upgrade interface also failed when I tried to go to asuswrt-merlin).

after i spooned my asus a couple of months ago, i found this page and some advice on the SBN forums.. the problem was caused by the tomato router firmware i tried uploading didn't work and it didnt reboot
or come back correctly and the reset didnt work because i think the tomato web updater messed up
Being a unix geek, i used the tftp commands because you can see clearly what's going on..
1. I did an NVRAM clear first by using the WPS button and power on, this worked. (fast blinking power light)
powered off
2. I did a reset button and power on, and firmware upload, slow flashing power light.
you have to power on the router.. do a ping from your machine to 192.168.1.1 - wait until you get a reply. then
3. did the tftp, completed on asus firmware.
psyfer:Downloads danilo$ tftp
tftp> connect 192.168.1.1
tftp> binary
tftp> put RT-AC68U_3.0.0.4_380_3831-g93dfe8c.trx
Sent 40280064 bytes in 34.9 seconds
tftp>
then wait... wait 5 minutes +
-
then reboot.
it worked
a treat.

Many thanks for your post Chris. I tried to update an rtn53 with the latest trx file from the asus site using the router's web based firmware update panel on linux/firefox and bricked it. Your procedure worked for me to recover.

I should clarify... the trx file worked fine using your procedures but failed using the router web interface.

On RT-AC51U the guide applies on the tftp part. But for some reason on two of my
routers ALWAYS tried to send TFTP -acknowledgements to a pre-defined IP address 192.168.1.75 so I had to set my computer to have this address. I managed to accidentally discover this with wireshark and there was no mention of it in any manual.
Also small side note was that I could not use the tftp -client on linux with the -c -parameter as for some reason when the "put" was done, the router reset itself without flashing the new firmware.

My experience comes from RT-AC66U
There is broadcom web UI accessible in rescue mode, it allows reset the nvram (solution for most of the firmware upgrade problems) just reset restart and have your router back.
It also allows to upload new firmware. The trick is to remember what was the previous LAN configuration and browse to the previous router address once you entered the rescue mode.
Rescue mode might not enter following the instruction provided, I recommend to disconnect power hold the reset button for 10 sec and connect the power back.

On the ASUS unit I have, this is indicated by a slowly flashing power light and a clear lack of Internet connectivity.
Make sure the other usual methods - power off, hold down the reset button, hold down the reset button as you power on.

Man thanks for this, I knew there had to be a specific protocol it was using, either ftp or tftp, and you confirmed my suspicions.
I just didn't know if the windows utility ran any other cmds to make it install the firmware.
I noticed the LED had stopped blinking after 5 minutes so I believed that meant the the firmware was done installing so maybe that can be something to check for as well.

Thanks! This is helpful even for windows users. Instructions helped me find and access the IP of the router (reset to ..1.1). At that point I could pull up a CFE miniweb server page on the router at that IP with an upload option I used that to upload the firmware file. One tip, upload as soon as you can get the miniweb server page to render after rebooting the router. That seemed to work when not doing that resulted in a page the eventually timed out. You'll get a success page if the file uploads successfully. FYI
