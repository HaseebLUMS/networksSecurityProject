JMAP Demo Webmail
This is a simple, but in many ways surprisingly sophisticated demo webmail client, making use of the JMAP JS library, and built on top of the Overture library. Hopefully this will make it easier for people to start hacking on JMAP immediately and get a feel for it. There's less than 2000 lines of non-library code - and that includes generous spacing and a few comments.
There's a hosted version at http://proxy.jmap.io, which uses the JMAP proxy to provide a JMAP interface to a Gmail or IMAP account.
The app showcases a number of features from the JMAP JS library:
It's fast. Because JMAP can load pretty much any view in one round trip.
You have full access to a complete mailbox, with no paging. Jump to any point and the data loads in quickly. The library is actually automatically prefetching a little bit either side of the section you currently need, so scrolling through it gives the illusion of a fully loaded mailbox.
All changes update the local UI instantly, then sync to the server in the background. If the server rejects the changes, the library will automatically revert the local cache so it stays in sync.
There's full, multi-level undo (and redo – Cmd-Shift-Z!) support. Again, the changes occur instantly in the client and are synced back to the server later. It can even handle undo when it's in the middle of syncing the original change to the server.
There's full push support. The EventSource connection to the server receives a new state token whenever something changes, which triggers the library to make a request to the server and get back the changes. Very fast, very efficient.
Installation
Clone the git repo, open index.html – it will talk to a basic simulated JMAP server (see fixtures.js) so you can try it locally. To talk to a real server, comment out the fixtures.js file in index.html, and modify the JMAP.auth.didAuthenticate call in state.js to tell it where to connect to.
License
All code and design is made available under the liberal MIT license. Please see the LICENSE file in the repo for full details.

Gmail has enjoyed phenomenal success, and regardless of which study you choose to look at for exact numbers, there's no doubt that Gmail is towards the top of the pack when it comes to market share. For certain circles, Gmail has become synonymous with email, or at least with webmail. Many appreciate its clean interface and the simple ability to access their inbox from anywhere.

But Gmail is far from the only name in the game when it comes to web-based email clients. In fact, there are a number of open source alternatives available for those who want more freedom, and occasionally, a completely different approach to managing their email without relying on a desktop client. You'll still need an email server to use with these clients. If you don't already have a favorite, look for an upcoming article with some options to consider.
Let's take a look at just a few of the free, open source webmail clients out there available for you to choose from.
Roundcube
First up on the list is Roundcube. Roundcube is a modern webmail client that will install easily on a standard LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack. It features a drag-and-drop interface that generally feels modern and fast, and comes with a slew of features: canned responses, spell checking, translation into over 70 languages, a templating system, tight address book integration, and many more. It also features a pluggable API for creating extensions.
It comes with a comprehensive search tool, and a number of features on the roadmap, from calendaring to a mobile UI to conversation view, sound promising, but at the moment these missing features do hold it back a bit compared to some other options.
Roundcube is available as open source under the GPLv3.

Zimbra
The next client on the list is Zimbra, which I have used extensively for work. Zimbra includes both a webmail client and an email server, so if you're looking for an all-in-one solution, it may be a good choice.
Zimbra is a well-maintained project that has been hosted at a number of different corporate entities through the years, and was acquired by Synacore in 2016. It features most of the things you've come to expect in a modern webmail client, from webmail to folders to contact lists to a number of pluggable extensions, and generally works very well. I have to admit that I'm most familiar with an older version of Zimbra, which felt at times slow and clunky, especially on mobile, but it appears that more recent versions have overcome these issues and provide a snappy, clean interface regardless of the device you are using. A desktop client is also available for those who prefer a more native experience. For more on Zimbra, see this article from Zimbra's Olivier Thierry, who shares a good deal more about Zimbra's role in the open source community.
Zimbra's web client is licensed under a Common Public Attribution License, and the server code is available under GPLv2. S

SquirrelMail
I have to admit, SquirrelMail (self-described as "webmail for nuts") does not have all of the bells and whistles of some more modern email clients, but it's simple to install and use and therefore was my go-to webmail tool for many years when I was setting up websites and needed a mail client that was easy and "just works." As I am no longer doing client work and shifted towards using forwarders instead of dedicated email accounts for personal projects, I realized it had been awhile since I took a look at SquirrelMail. For better or for worse, it's exactly where I left it.
SquirrelMail started in 1999 as an early entry into the field of webmail clients, with a focus on low resource consumption on both the server and client side. It requires little in the way of special extensions of technologies to be used, which back when it was created was quite important, as browsers had not yet standardized in the way we expect them to be today. The flip side of its somewhat dated interface is that it has been tested and used in production environments for many years, and it's a good choice for someone who wants a webmail client with few frills but also few headaches to administer.
SquirrelMail is written in PHP and is licensed under the GPL.

Rainloop
Next up is Rainloop. Rainloop is a very modern entry into the webmail arena, and its interface is definitely closer to what you might expect if you're used to Gmail or another commercial email client. It comes with most features you've come to expect, including email address autocompletion, drag-and-drop and keyboard interfaces, filtering support, and many others, and it can easily be extended with additional plugins. It integrates with other online accounts like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Dropbox for a more connected experience, and it also renders HTML emails very well compared to some other clients I've used, which can struggle with complex markup.
It's easy to install, and you can try Rainloop in an online demo to decide if it's a good fit for you.
Rainloop is primarily written in PHP, and the community edition is licensed under the AGPL. You can also check out the source code on GitHub.

More options
Mailspring is a new option that supports multiple accounts, read receipts, translations, undo send, and other popular email client features. It is a fork developed by one of the creators of Nylas Mail, which was maintained until Spring 2017.
Cypht is a lightweight email client and news reader written in PHP and JavaScript and licensed under GPL v2. It was developed by the creators of HastyMail, an older GPL-licensed email client.
Mailpile is an HTML 5 email client, written in Python, and available under the AGPL. Currently in development, Mailpile focuses on speed and privacy.
WebMail Lite is a modern but minimalist option, licensed under the AGPL and written mostly in PHP.
Open WebMail is a GPL-licensed client that aims to provide efficient memory management for very large mail files.
Kite was on the list the last time we published this review, but it's now obsolete. It was designed to go head-to-head with Gmail, and it's too bad the project didn't advance.
There are also a number of groupware solutions, such as Horde, which provide webmail in addition to other collaboration tools.
This is by no means a comprehensive list. What's your favorite open source webmail client?
Editor's note: This article was originally published in 2015, and has been updated to reflect changes in available software options.

I'm using Roundcube primarily. I got used to it. I can't wait for the v2 to be released (which was successfully crowdfunded a couple of months ago: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/roundcube-next--2#/story )!

You'd think that an open source program would be more vulnerable to attack, but it's actually the opposite. Because more people can see the code and its vulnerabilities, there's a better chance of those vulnerabilities being fixed. Once a vulnerability is fixed, it's just a matter of people updating their software. Linus' law: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"

I really like Horde's mobile UI, and the mail client was pretty easy to install separate from the rest of it. SquirrelMail and RoundCube are challenging to use on a mobile device. RoundCube has a supposed mobile plugin but I could not get it to work.

They are the upstream of Roundcube. The service is excellent and the nominal fee helps support upstream development of Roundcube and other very important open source projects.

The title for this article is VERY misleading! It incorrectly implies (or at least one may infer) that you will NOT be using gmail.
Perhaps if it had the word 'client' in it... Better yet, because these 'clients' will work with any email service, leave gmail out of the title, i.e., "5 open source (alternative) email clients" would be much more apt and thus more informative and truthful ('alternative' in parens because not necessary). And I bet these clients are compatible with most other email services as well. Why are you choosing gmail?
Or did you intend that the title be 'click bait' because you needed traffic because you're losing audience..?
Other than that, good and informatve article... Thank you for the research/information

The author clearly states that these are web client alternatives to the popular Gmail (which is by far the most widely used web email service, hence why it was chosen over the many others that do exist). It then goes to say in order to use them, you will need to also host your own email server, and says a guide for those will be coming in the future. Zimbra though actually is also a server making it a complete package.
So, the title is accurate as this is a start to building a alternative to the popular Gmail service. Hope this helps. Thanks.

My favorite one is Tutanota: https://tutanota.com
It's the antipode of Gmail as it encrypts all your data. It is not possible to scan my data for advertisement or infringe my privacy in any way. Plus i can get the code from guthub and run the client locally. I'd be very happy to see an article here about Tutanota one day! If we want to get rid of Gmail, built-in encryption is the right way to go.

Fail. Why? Because all of these are fat downloads and none are as easy as going to a webpage like gmail, creating an ID and viola, done! Your ordinary users are not going to download software just because they want email. Duh. Amazing how clueless these software and email client companies are.

They're not clients... All of these are server software, and by running one on a webserver you will have your own "webpage like gmail". Duh. Yes, it will take longer to set up than writing off your most sensitive information to Google, but you (or rather, an ordinary user with an ounce of patience) will have your mail in an environment that you control.
Amazing how clueless— nah, I'm not going to stoop to that.

I set up Squirrel Mail on a laptop server once for a demonstration. It isn't elegant but we were looking for ways to cut costs at our K-12 school district and this was a viable option.

These solutions are hosted solutions AKA you install them on a server and then you can use simply a web browser as you would for gmail and serve as many clients as you wich!
So they are indeed gmail server replacement!... ;-)

Mails need NOT be handled by Googles servers. You can choose any hosting provider you like or host it on an in-house server if you have enough bandwidth and are prepared to set up the security required.

I've run Zimbra, Squirrelmail and Round Cube in the best and they all do the front end job just fine - the hard part is the server end of things. Except for Zimbra, you have to either deal with the IMAP server supplied by a hosting company or set up your own (Zimbra includes an IMAP server). The big problem there is spam - filtering it and then trying to either filter more or tweak it to reduce false positives. It's a constant battle of keeping Spam Assassin up to date, RBLs, grey listing, SPF, DKIM, etc. I can't keep up with it just for an email box. Worse is hosting emails for others, now you have to research and explain why email x was put in the spam folder and email y was not. Finally, I caved and went to gmail and haven't looked back. Gmail, Office 365, Yahoo Mail, whatever your poison - all have spam filtering I could not replicate, high availability, ubiquitous clients - I can focus on my actual work instead of dorking around with mail server tweaks, updates, etc.

It's true that in the US it's a bit less known but if you want to talk about complete and Enterprise ready Collaboration Platform then you should have a look at Zarafa: http://www.zarafa.com/
It's not just perfect as a MS Exchange replacement which uses a fraction of the resources and costs, it also includes video conferencing, instant messaging, file sharing, email encryption, etc...

Good post.
1.
I used to install Squirrel. Worked allways very good. BUT: development stopped some years (more than 3) ago. Servers were attacked. There are no updates. Even not for security. Old php-versions requiered. So my firm recommendation is to NOT install this any more.
2.
I switched to Roundcube and Rainloop. Both are stable and working well. You can easily use them in parallel. And I do this because each of them has advantages concerning the usability. Also, roundcube started crowdfunding to reprogram every part using modern frameworks. This will put it more to responsiveness.
These two programs are also perfectly integrated into my server control management.

I used to use Squirrelmail, and then moved on to Roundcube. The problem I've had with these has mainly been that it uses the old folder paradigm (thus also requiring an external system for filtering rules). Sieve scripts are fine for neckbeards but definitely not the sort of experience that most users are going to want. I've not really seen anything yet that uses labels & views with integrated rule policies.

Why are all the comments' dates so old? Is this a repost or smth?
Anyway, I run kmail for my email but I like Roundcube pretty much (I work for a web hosting company so setting up my own mail server is not an issue :) ).
At work we started using OpenXchange recently, which is nice, but I still prefer Roundcube for my ocassional use.

As for me, the title is confusing and leads to a misunderstanding.
Because all of so-called 'alternatives' are not actually alternatives to Gmail. You use Gmail client in your webbrowser and the 'client-ware' resides in the Google cloud, you do not install anything on your desktop or home or company Intranet. In order to use an 'alternative' you need installing the whole infrastructure. If you want to use it everywhere - you have to expose it in the Internet, which always brings security threats. Otherwise - you are bounded to your Intranet.

Hosting your own email server to take back control of your privacy and data isn't that difficult at all.
Many small businesses have or can get decent connectivity, at least in metropolitan areas, and can get a public IP so they could setup their own services knowing nothing or very little about Linux by using platforms like ClearOS, Univention or Collax to mention a few on top of which they can install with a few clicks a replacement for GMail. I personally use/recommend Kopano but if you need basic features others will do.
Private users can do a similar thing by renting a small VPS for $5/10(?) a month and install, or get their nerdy friends to install, their preferred GMail replacement.
True that it's more convenient to use "Cloud" services as it's convenient to let other people decide for you but then they can't complain if their data gets lost or is used against them.

This article is misleading for sure and misses the point a lot. However, an Open Source Alternative to this implies that you will host it yourself somewhere so you provide the cloud.
If you setup a mail server and then one of these clients then you don't have to install anything locally and install you just use the web versions of these clients.
Mail Server + Rainloop on a public facing server = your personal email cloud.
This article skips the Mail Server part which is easily the most important thing and that is unfortunate. You can't connect Rainloop to a server that doesn't exist. This was not a very well thought out article.

It seems like this article has been "re-dated".
I take the opportunity to let you all know that the Open Source alternative to GMail & even Office365 is Kopano, the evolution of Zarafa, which now sports also integrations with MatterMost (MS Team/Slack services) and LibreOffice Online.
Kopano is available in Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSuse and Fedora repositories, as source code and as packages ready to use for most Linux distributions. See https://kopano.com for more info.

zimbra is ok to compare to a email suite like google. I miss zohomail from this list. Now, talking about roundcube, squirrel, made me travel back in time, really. These things are soooo 2004. I remember more than 10 years ago people telling me to use roundcube because it was made using AJAX... hahaha.. boy I feel old now. Although
those tools are still available and have modern install methods like iredmail, how would you make your clamav and spamassassin good as Gmail's antivirus and antispam. Sum up with greylisting, content filtering, the amazing interface and filters... config tools far beyond webmin/cpanel dashboards. Sometimes you have to leverage your things to available free tools and focus on what it matters. And if your email is too important to be handled by google like as if you are a government or something, I would go for a paid solution like IBM email or try out with zimbra and zoho. cheers guys.

It would be great if the author went further than writing a superficial description of these mail clients. It is obvious he has not tried some of the applications, at least not recently. Doesn't he know, for example, that SquirrelMail is currently a dormant project?

I think it's hilarious that pretty much all of the complaints on this article are from people who clearly didn't read it. Is this a repost? Yes, it says at the bottom it was originally posted two years ago and updated. Do you still need an email server to use with your webmail client? Yes, the author literally says that in the second paragraph.

I agree with some of the later comments, that perhaps the article needs a little more depth. Especially, if you're a Gmail user, why would you want another email client? Are you trying to consolidate email? Or are you looking for a better user experience? If so, what are the advantages of getting away from webmail to, say, a native client?
And there was a comment about the article being incomplete since it does not include mail servers and this may be true too.
I think some foreground explaining why this article is important would have helped.

I recently switching my hosting from GoDaddy to another company and quickly realized that their webmail client was actually pretty good with the exception of using HTML messages with images where I had a lot of problems as I use this often.
I settled on Roundcube but it feels dated and has some limitations I had to get used to also, most notable with use of bcc: which I use extensively in conjunction with Highrise.
I'm trying to see if
any of these other clients may be a better fit.

Running a secure email server these days is a full-time job.
I pay for a personal ProtonMail account (https://protonmail.ch).
No ads or snooping through my e-mail content by a "big-brother" hosting service like Google or Yahoo.
ProtonMail is modern, private, secure e-mail with excellent SPAM filtering at a reasonable cost.
