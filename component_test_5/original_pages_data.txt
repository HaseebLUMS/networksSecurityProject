Technicolor TG589vac - Wireless Settings
Aim of this article:
This article provides a step-by-step guide to amending the wireless password and network name (SSID) settings on the Technicolor TG589vac router. It also shows you how to access and amend the 5GHZ and guest network settings.
Before starting:
Your device will need to be connected to the router either via Ethernet, or by using the existing wireless configuration details printed on the router itself, or on the small wireless settings card which is supplied inside the router's packaging.
Change the Wireless Password or Network Name (SSID):
Open an Internet browser. Launch the Technicolor interface by visiting: http://192.168.1.1
Click the Sign In button in the top-right of the screen:
Login using the username engineer and your password, which is the unique access key printed underneath your router. Note: the access key is case-sensitive.
Click Sign in to continue.
You will now be taken back to the main Technicolor interface.
Now, click on the Wireless options to load the settings.
If you wish to update your network name from the default one provided, simply amend the content of the SSID name field, replacing this with the new name you wish to give to the network.
You can amend the wireless password by updating the Wireless Password box.
You are also able to adjust futher settings, such as the current wireless channel, using this screen.
Once you have entered a new password - ensuring you have also made note of this - and updated any other settings required, you should click the Save button to save the new configuration.
Accessing the 5ghz wireless and guest wireless settings:
The TG589vac router also supports 5ghz wireless for faster speeds, as well as a guest wireless network.
To access the 5ghz settings, you will need to open the Wireless Settings as normal, then select your network name under the Access Points 5GHZ menu. This will have the same network name as your usual wireless network, but with "-5G" added to the end.
Please note: By default the 5ghz network has the same password as the 2.4ghz network. If you amend the wireless password for your 2.4ghz network, this will not automatically amend the password for the 5ghz version.
There are also guest networks set-up on both the 2.4ghz and 5ghz spectrums, you can view and amend the password for these by clicking on their names in the network list.

I've found a way to bypass authentication on most of Technicolor and Thomson routers.
Inspite of my efforts contacting them, they didn't replied to my emails, so I would like to disclosure it over here.
As my Python skills aren't the best yet, is there any python master over there who would like to help me writing it?

@cusspvz While I can try my best, I really need said router on hand to develop the exploit. Perhaps someone else would be willing to pick it up.

@cusspvz do you have access to the vulnerable device?
This exploit requires multiple steps:
Connecting to the FTP service with upgrade account credentials and download configuration file
Extract data from configuration file and use it to build valid cookie
Connect to the web interface with crafted cookie and check if authentication has been bypassed
The result of exploit is valid cookie that can be copy/pasted to the browser which lets you access web interface. Maybe device has some cool vulns after authentication like os command injection?
These multiple steps make creating exploit hard without vulnerable device.

@Bouncingbunny does it help if I provide the steps you need to take and test the script on this side? Inspite I do not develop on python, I think I can finish it up if you write the base.
Dependencies you will need:
ftp python module
net python module
http python module
Note: If on any of the expected part fails, it isn't vulnerable.
Options:
target - defaults to 192.168.1.254
account - defaults to upgrade
password - defaults to Th0ms0n!
config-ftp-path - defaults to user.ini
new-account - exploited-admin
new-password - exploited-admin
Here are the steps to check:
Check if upgrade account is available
Connect to target tcp socket at 23 (telnet)
Expect Username :
Write upgrade
Expect Login not allowed (this means the user exist but isn't allowed to login via telnet)
Expect http and ftp ports opened
Here are the steps to run:
Check if option.account account is available
Connect to target tcp socket at 23 (telnet)
Expect Username :
Write option.account
Expect Password :
Write option.password
Expect Login not allowed (this means the user exist but isn't allowed to login via telnet)
Connect to ftp
Login with option.account and option.password
Stream down the options.config-ftp-path
Add line (will edit this later)
Stream up the options.config-ftp-path
Warn user with login details
Print out the url, newly created account and password.
The exploit allows to bypass authentication because you have direct access to the configuration file, but since it would be a little tricky to implement the cookie sharing after login, maybe it is better to inject a new user on it.
I will edit this later with a way to do this. (give me a couple of minutes)

@cusspvz I know the process of exploiting the vulnerability, but because it has so many steps, I do need a copy of the router to complete it. I can write it and then send it to you to test and then you can tell me what to fix, if that's okay.

@Bouncingbunny Will you take the cookie injection approach or the creation of a new user? Just asking to know if I need to edit the comment above.

@cusspvz https://ghostbin.com/paste/w8253 I implemented a check function. Can you try it for me? The run function doesn't work right now.

It isn't working, not because of the code but because of Telnet implementation. I've spent almost 20min investigating the case and seems read_until doesn't work flawless, there are some known issues on it, on the discussion (cannot recall where) they suggested to use static sleepers instead. I've tried it but no luck...
Here's what happened:
First i though it was fault of login : instead of Username :, changed but it didn't fixed.
It wasn't my first experience with python, so I've added some prints to check either lines were being executed and removed the @mute decorator.
Seems it was passing on the first read_until('Username : ') but not on the password one.
I've added timeout to the read_until, it passed but it didn't worked, so I've changed all the read_until statements to sleep( 2 ), telnet implementation wasn't able to read it.
Do you have any kind of thompson equipment?

@cusspvz I only have a netgear router running either dd-wrt or tomato, not sure which.
Can you telnet into the router and tell me exactly what the prompt is when you connect and login?

What's up guys ?
@cusspvz is the exploit working or not ?
@nymx is that ghostbin script the last version of your exploit ?
I can work on it further and finalize it if needed. Let me know

I think so.

Here you have a detailed workflow for achieving the exploit.

Thx for your reply @cusspvz but I don't understand...
You told me the exploit is working, so I guess the work is done.
So can I create a pull request to this repo with his script ? If not, are there still steps to do ? Which ?

Sorry, I tough you were referring if the exploit (the procedure) was working and not the exploit implementation (the python procedure script).
The python script wasn't.
If not, are there still steps to do ? Which ?
Don't remember, the last time I had tested it wasn't detecting the telnet responses as it should.
The conversation was at that point. My latest message before your intervention was the IO of the telnet on an affected router.

Ok I found the telnet problem in @nymx 's script, he wasn't following the RFC with the use of '\n' at the end of the instruction.
Telnet specification says that '\r\n' must be used.
The Telnet end-of-line sequence CR LF MUST be used to send Telnet data that is not terminal-to-computer (e.g., for Server Telnet sending output, or the Telnet protocol incorporated another application protocol).
I'm going further with the FTP connection.

@0BuRner I wasn't creating a new user, but it should work as well.
Instead, I was grabbing hash from the configuration file and requesting a session using it.

Seems hash2 is a concatenation of user, realm and password, all joined using :.
It seems they don't save the password, but instead only the hash generated on login/user registration.
Proof:

@cusspvz Thanks for your feedback. Then can you provide me the steps on how to request a session using this hash ? Or at least how to exploit this vulnerability ?
In your steps you said :
Add line (will edit this later)
Stream up the options.config-ftp-path
Warn user with login details
Print out the url, newly created account and password.
And in my case hash2 is not the problem, but password following this pattern is problematic : password= _CYP2_{} since I need to know how to generate that encrypted pwd. Is this equivalent to the hidepw form element ?
Or maybe you can give me a known encrypted password and I'll add it but then the user can't choose with the options.
Moreover I don't think it's a good idea to publicly disclose that configuration file here x)
@lucyoa The exploit is not finished yet. Only check method is done and some of usefull methods for further if I remember well. Do you want I create a pull request anyway ?

Please note, this router also have digest auth. The basicHttp responce module will not working. On the script that was provided by @cusspvz I can see the next:
HA1=MD5(username:realm:password)
HA2=MD5(method:digestURI)
It measns that this is digest auth MD5 calulating
proof:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication
I had the issue #176 with this method, so I decided write about it here, to prevent possibility of the same mistakes. There is the ready module for this in python-requests, it is unnecessary to write additional lines to calculate
HA1 and HA2

@0BuRner let's give a try on CYP line instead of CYP2 line?
I've read that recent firmwares also accept the CYP format.
Add realm as a option (it could be Technicolor Gateway or Thomson Gateway).
Calculate hash2: MD5( username + ':' + realm +':' + passord )
Calculate password cyp: '_CYP_' + MD5( password )
Add a line under
[ mlpuser.ini ]:
add name=${username} password=${passwordCYP} role=SuperUser hash2=${hash2}`

I was able to get vulnerable device and play a little bit with it.
Exploitation with injecting additional user does not seem to work properly.
It looks like it is required to restart device so new settings can be loaded. I didnt have enough time to investigate that so its just a guess.
@0BuRner I modified your exploit from your fork and now it extracts configuration and builds valid javascript payloads that you can use through developer tools to bypass authentication.

Security checklist for Technicolor TG582n router
To login to Technicolor TG582n router and change the network name and password,
Start with opening your favorite browser,then in the address bar enter the IP Address http://192.168.1.254, You will now be taken to the login page where you can enter the default username: blank and password: blank Change Technicolor TG582n default Login and Password or reset it if you dont remember Change Technicolor TG582n default Wifi name (SSID) / Password.Continue reading for detailed step-by-step instructions
1.Open Technicolor TG582n Router IP Address Technicolor TG582nRouter Internal IP Address: http://192.168.1.254Open link
(Remember you must be at home and connected to home wifi to do this)
2.Login to the Technicolor TG582n Router
You will now be taken to the login page where you can enter default username: blank and password: blank to complete the login process (You can simply use the copy-paste below). Voila! You are now logged in!
Default username for Technicolor TG582n: blank
Default password for Technicolor TG582n: blank
And no need to get your breathing rates high in case you have changed the username/ password of Technicolor TG582n and forgot them, as you can just reset the Technicolor TG582n router by press-and-hold the reset button with a clip for about 15 seconds.
3.Change Technicolor TG582n Default Login and Password Since, security of a network is vital, the first and foremost task is to change the Technicolor TG582n router Default Login and Password to something more personal and secure
Technicolor TG582n Router Password Tips:
Choose a complex and hard-to-guess password for your Technicolor which only you can remember It should be something personal, like &ilostmyvirginity@30, so that you will never forget it. Ever
Protect it The amount of protection directly depends on the password complexity, and the effort taken to protect that password of your Technicolor TG582n router
Usability first Give Password for your Technicolor TG582n router that you can remember (usability first). Of course, you can build a strong hash password with special character, numbers, greek and latin. But ultimately you will endup writing it on a sticky and putting it on the router which defeats the purpose. Here’s an example $lasttriptovegas0916
4.Change Technicolor TG582n Default Wifi name (SSID) and Password and enable Network Encryption Another small suggestion (as it has no impact on security), is to change the Technicolor TG582n Default Wifi name (SSID) as it will make it more obvious for others to know which network they are connecting to.
Look for Network Name (SSID), this is the wifi name of your Technicolor TG582n Router. Don’t use your name, home address or other personal information (since this isn’t a Facebook status!) in the SSID name. (No Mr.Paul&Princy) Few funny wifi name suggestions: I’m cheating on my WiFi!, FBI Surveillance Van #594 (scares away stupid criminals), Lord of the Pings... Once you enter the name for your network, you have to enable WPA2-PSK encryption on your Technicolor TG582n router. That’s the strongest encryption standard available for home networks. Enter a new WPA Pre-Shared Key / Wifi Password – this is the password that you will use to connect to your home wifi. Keep it 16-20 characters and (please!) don’t use the same password that you used for Technicolor TG582n router login! You did good so far, Now consider ⭐ Bookmarking this page, It always helps
We are looking for Sponsors ! Modemly helps hundreds of thousands of people every month to setup a safe and secure internet environment. We are looking for sponsors for our site Read more
5.Few more settings that you can consider for your Technicolor TG582n router You need or need not choose to consider this step; it is both obsolete and quite a hassle! •You can consider MAC Address filtering for Technicolor TG582n router. But, you will have to essentially login to the router to add any new devices by feeding the device’s MAC address everytime you have a guest. Your date might want to check his/her emails, you know? •There are a lot of resources in Internet asking to Disable SSID Broadcast on your Technicolor TG582n, but it’s more painful for you to connect every time than the hacker. Just forget, We don’t even recommend it
6.Security is a continuous process Just keep in mind to change the passwords often or at least once in every 6 months! on your Technicolor TG582n You do not want the safety you have worked so hard for to fail just because of ignorance, negligence or casual laziness! Time for a bulletin on the fridge, folks! We can remind you though? Enter your email on below! Nope, we’re not spammers!

Technicolor TG582n router login issues:
Technicolor TG582n Password Doesn't Work Passwords find a way to not work! Or, in most cases, users find a way to forget them! In either case, look up the “How to Reset the Technicolor TG582n Router to Default Settings” section below
Forgot Password to Technicolor TG582n Router Incase if you have changed the default username and password of Technicolor TG582n and forgot it, Please see “How to Reset the Technicolor TG582n Router To Default Settings” section below
How to Reset the Technicolor TG582n Router To Default Settings Incase if you have changed the default username and password of Technicolor TG582n and forgot it, It’s more like magic, I’d say! Press the reset button with a pin or something that gets through the tiny hole, and hold it for about 15 seconds! (till you see all lights flickering) Your Technicolor TG582n router shall be reset in no time, and you can start from step 1 in this guide to set it back up
How to boost Technicolor TG582n Wifi and overcome connectivity issues:
1.Place the Technicolor TG582n in a perfect spot The perfect spot does it all; be it romance or your router! To avail the best signal and network connectivity, make sure you keep your Technicolor TG582n router visibly and not facing the wall or behind the curtains
2.Find a Good Wireless Channel Instead of Auto on your Technicolor TG582n router Auto channels might fail you once in a while; believe that you’re smarter than the Technicolor router! Find a seamless wireless channel instead of what the router finds automatically. This would ensure that your signal does not interfere with that of your neighbors. If you’re running a Windows-based PC, you can see what channels neighboring Wi-Fi networks are using. -Press Start > type “cmd”. Open Command prompt -In command prompt type netsh wlan show all You will see a list of all wireless networks and the channels being used in your vicinity. instead of using “Auto” for the control channel, Pick the channel that has the lowest interference
3.Check the frequency of Technicolor TG582n Check If Technicolor TG582n has dual-band, the more commonly used band would be 2.4GHz; however, switching to 5GHz would bring out better results! It depends on your device though; if you’re running an old lad, you might have to switch back to the conventional.
4.Hardwire gaming consoles / media streamers into your Technicolor TG582n instead of wifi Gaming consoles/media streamers work better when connected through Ethernet cable of Technicolor TG582n; in fact, as you might not be moving your TV all over the house, why connect it to the Wi-Fi at all? The gaming consoles / video streaming devices flood the network with data. This means that if possible, you should consider hardwire (using Ethernet cable) the devices that tend to consume a lot of bandwidth. Although this can sort of defeat the purpose of having wireless network, but it can actually help your overall network speed of Technicolor TG582n if you can hardwire the bandwidth hogs.
5. Reboot Technicolor TG582n on a schedule Here is something important to note! On schedule, folks, reboot your Technicolor TG582n router! Though routers are built to constantly be running at all times, simple tweak like regular power cycling (a fancy way of saying unplugging the power cord and shoving it back up) helps with most issues. Rebooting your Technicolor TG582n can fix Internet connection problems, improve slow moving connections and resolve wireless issues altogether. Try unplugging your Technicolor modem on a quarterly basis to stay proactive (Never reset, always reboot modem)Technicolor TG587n v3 – Getflix Knowledge Base

Note: This is an advanced procedure since it's not possible to add static routes on the user interface, you need to use the Telnet command.
Open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal window (Mac), and type the following commands:
telnet 10.0.0.138username : admin password : (just hit enter) {admin}=> ip rtadd dst=8.8.8.8 dstmsk=255.255.255.255 gateway=10.0.0.138 metric=3 intf=Internet{admin}=> ip rtadd dst=8.8.4.4 dstmsk=255.255.255.255 gateway=10.0.0.138 metric=3 intf=Internet {admin}=> ip rtadd dst=208.67.222.222 dstmsk=255.255.255.255 gateway=10.0.0.138 metric=3 intf=Internet {admin}=> ip rtadd dst=209.244.0.3 dstmsk=255.255.255.255 gateway=10.0.0.138 metric=3 intf=Internet{admin}=> saveall (this may take a few seconds)
Note 1: The gateway entry above (10.0.0.138) is the router's default IP address. You will need to substitute the IP address of your own router if it is different.
Note 2: If the dstmsk option fails or is not available, enter the dst value only, but add a "/32" to the end, so the first entry would look like this: dst=8.8.8.8/32
Note 3: If the Telnet command returns an unknown command error in Windows, see these instructions for enabling it: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/910.windows-7-enabling-telnet-client.aspx
Note 4: For NETFLIX of any device app you also need to add following static routes;
Network Address: 45.57.0.0Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0Gateway: (use the IP address of your router)
Network Address: 108.175.0.0Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0Gateway: (use the IP address of your router)
Network Address: 185.2.0.0Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0Gateway: (use the IP address of your router)
Network Address: 198.45.0.0Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0Gateway: (use the IP address of your router)
Additional RoutesSome of our users also suggested the use following static routes. But these may also cause issues on some other user networks. So please use the first set of static routes first and then if needed you can try followings:Network Address: 23.246.0.0Subnet Mask: 255.255.192.0 (or /18)Gateway: (use the IP address of your router) Network Address: 198.38.96.0Subnet Mask: 255.255.224.0 (or /19)Gateway: (use the IP address of your router)

Handy info for checking what's running in your modem
What's that System Extras tab and what can I do in there?
My firmware is so old that AutoFlashGUI can't authenticate to the modem!
I want to factory reset 17.2 but I don't want to have to re-flash (aka Ghetto Reset!)
I'm selling this modem, how do I securely wipe all the config?
The basics
The TG799vac, known more commonly in Australia as the “Telstra Gateway Max” is a very capable piece of equipment. It has 802.11ac, a VDSL / ADSL2 modem (meaning NBN FTTN compatibility), a DECT base station, 2 x FXS ports for analogue ports, and an FXO port, is known for getting high sync speeds for VDSL2, has a high quality internal PCB and power supply and it's power consumption is quite good at 12 watts with WiFi on (typical router config) and 9 watts with WiFi off (typical bridge mode config). The newer verstions of this device are the TG800 "Telstra Gateway Max 2" and DJN2103 "Telstra Gateway Frontier", which most of the following will also apply to, if the device has a firmware version low enough, or which it can still be downgraded to.
They are provided directly to Telstra – and as such, has Telstra branded firmware. There is no ‘generic’ firmware available that will just give you access to the modem as any other device you would purchase. Personally, I think this kind of sucks – as if you decide to use this device with anyone other than Telstra, you lose access to the VoIP functionality, DECT base station, FXO ports. That was the motivation to get into this device and re-enable as many features as possible.
By default, the IP address of the modem will be 10.0.0.138.
This guide is the "new version" which uses the flashing tool developed by Mark Smith as well as the input from the Whirlpool community to enable as many features as possible.
To use this guide you must be on firmware 17.2.0188-820-RA or lower (there are reports that the 17.2.0188-820-RB variant has the web flashing functionality disabled) or be able to downgrade to it.
What you will need to proceed:
The AutoFlashGUI tool. This is compiled for windows but if you have Python 3 installed see the instructions at the top of the source\autoflashgui.py for installing missing modules so you can run this on any OS (the latest version will ask to install missing modules but if it fails you may have to install them manually). Make sure you can run this tool and load the GUI up before you go offline!
The v16.3 firmware rbi for your modem.
The v17.2.0188-820-RA rbi file for your modem (If you flash to anything newer you may lock yourself out of the modem permanently).
A SSH client. The famous Putty SSH client is recommended on Windows.
A copy of this web page for reference while you're offline.
Physical access to the modem so you can power cycle it and unplug the WAN/DSL while you're going through this process.
A 'happy' modem! If it's in bridge mode or half the tiles are missing on the screen (which seems to be caused by corrupted config), factory reset it first.
The basic steps to getting root access to firmware v17.2 on your modem
These instructions refer to the TG799, so if you are doing this for a different modem be sure to use the correct file names for the firmare.
Run up the AutoFlashGUI tool and flash vant-f_CRF683-17.2.188-820-RA.rbi to your modem.
This will take about 3-4 minutes. The flasher will try and root your modem but it will fail (silently) - this is expected. If the flash fails to push the firmware in, try again (is the username and password correct?), and if it still fails with some permission error in the console, you may have been locked out of flashing via the web interface: bad luck. Maybe a PXE firmware load can help but you require good luck at this point. Ask for help in the whirlpool thread! (Note that firmware before v15.x may require some manual work, see 'My firmware is so old that AutoFlashGUI can't authenticate to the modem!' )
Now use AutoFlashGUI to flash in vant-f_CRF687-16.3.7567-660-RG.rbi and allow it to run through including getting root.
At this point we are ready to do the procedure to activate root on 17.2 and switch over to it. This procedure works by allowing us to mod the inactive (but newer) image's file system and config, then switch back to it without doing a factory reset or official upgrade. Note that if you factory reset while on 17.2 you will need to run the entire procedure from where you flashed v16.3 to get root back, and it could upgrade and lock you out permanently in that reset state if it has internet access!
Fire up your SSH client and connect to the modem on port 22.
Have a look at your current modem state. It should look something like this:
# find /proc/banktable -type f -print -exec cat {} ';'
/proc/banktable/notbootedoid
59b21e26bc549719f7f1bedd
/proc/banktable/bootedoid
5940db6a20338215a4c97c89
/proc/banktable/passiveversion
17.2.0188-7021004-20170908063550-00f42f11f9c253e3f1001b1558043e970a3d9b5d
/proc/banktable/activeversion
16.3.7567-2521030-20170614084458-887a8c777ed8527277d7137ed9149816c889cf1d
/proc/banktable/inactive
bank_2
/proc/banktable/active
bank_1
/proc/banktable/notbooted
bank_2
/proc/banktable/booted
bank_1
These modems use two flash partitions (bank_1 and bank_2) which can be upgraded/used almost independently.  They are digital-signature verified before boot so you can't edit the rom image in the flash.  The config is stored in the matching folder in /overlay i.e. /overlay/bank_2 (hint: you can see your modified config files in here if you want to back stuff up or see what changes you made).  When a proper factory reset is done, the overlay partition is formatted (but not securely wiped - see section later).
Run the following to set 17.2 up for temporary root and switch back to it:
# rm -rf /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/inactive`
# mkdir /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/inactive`
# chmod 755 /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/inactive`
# mkdir /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/inactive`/etc
# chmod 775 /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/inactive`/etc
# echo "echo root:root | chpasswd" > /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/inactive`/etc/rc.local
# echo "dropbear -p 6666 &" >> /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/inactive`/etc/rc.local
# chmod +x /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/inactive`/etc/rc.local
# echo `cat /proc/banktable/inactive` > /proc/banktable/active
# sync
# cat /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`/etc/rc.local
Now check it all looks right - you should get this output from the last command:
echo root:root | chpasswd
dropbear -p 6666 &
Reboot and wait 3 to 4 minutes for the modem to boot into 17.2.
Setting up firmware v17.2
Log in to the modem with SSH on port 6666 using root/root.  At this point you have temporary root on 17.2, but it's not how we should leave things.
Run the following in SSH to turn on more functionality and clean up. Note that you can only paste so much into the terminal in one go, so if you get weird errors just cut the block back a bit and try again:

Now change the root password:

Reboot now if you're not doing any futher configuration.

VOIP Setup
If you want to use VOIP, the following is the quickest way to set it up and remove some broken config that causes calls to be sent out via the FXO port which will be unplugged for everyone in Australia once you are on NBN unless you are in a fixed wireless area where the voice services are still being delivered over the copper lines.  We also reset the LAN SIP inbound passwords here for security (see 'LAN SIP client use of the mini-PABX in the modem'  to use them if you wish to but nothing else has to be done). Please don't post the default passwords in public forums as they could be a security risk for those still using them!

Running the TG799 as the router with a second router behind it (double nat)
Double NAT used to break many things, but testing with this configuration shows that most current applications are very tollerant of it. Most applications assume they are on a private network and that their visible IP is not the one they are visible on on the internet via, so if it's nested one more level down via NAT with a DMZ redirecting traffic to the second router's WAN interface it makes very little difference (if this guide is followed)!
There are many reasons you would want to do this:
You have a complex network setup with a more advanced router running services such as a VPN server and you still want to use the VOIP in the TG799 so that it can manage the packet priority tagging properly.
You don't quite trust the TG799
You want a simpler solution than the "Using bridge mode with a dedicated PPPoE ethernet port" section below outlines which can be a nightmare to set up and debug if something goes wrong.
You want easy access to the TG799 GUI so you can get sync speeds etc at the modem's IP. This is still possible in bridged mode but it's less stright forward.
Here is how you go setting this up properly:
Set up the TG799 as above fully including VOIP etc and make sure it works to your satisfaction.
The TG799's default LAN IP on Telstra firmware is 10.0.0.138 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0. If your inner router also has a default LAN subnet of 10.0.0.0 then it's advised to change one of them (probably the TG799 so your network will not be disrupted) to a subnet of your choosing such as 10.0.100.0 subnet mask 255.255.255.0. The rest of this section assumes you moved the TG799's LAN IP to 10.0.100.1 subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
Add a "static lease" on the TG799 under Advanced -> Local Network -> Static Leases with your internal router's WAN MAC address and a suitable ip such as 10.0.100.2.
Connect your inner router's WAN port to one of the TG799's LAN ports.
Confirm on the inner router that it got 10.0.100.2 as the WAN IP. If it did not, reboot both of them at the same time to get rid of any lingering DHCP leases. If that fails re-check the MAC address of the lease handed out from the TG799.
On the TG799 under Advanced -> WAN Services -> DMZ enable it and set the IP to 10.0.100.2 . Set up DynDNS if you want to. Save.
Turn off WiFi on the TG799.
At this point the TG799 should be transparent to incoming requests which will hit the WAN interface of your internal router and be handled normally.
Really advanced topics !
Changing max sync speeds
You can change the max values for sync speeds. The value maxusdatarate
controls the upstream maximum sync speed, maxdsdatarate
controls the downstream maximum sync speed, and maxaggrdatarate
is the maximum combined speed. The defaults are listed below. This doesn’t change any limitations imposed by line length – or at the DSLAM. If you won the node lotto and are feeling lucky you can modify these like so:
uci set xdsl.dsl0.maxaggrdatarate='160000'
uci set xdsl.dsl0.maxdsdatarate='110000'
uci set xdsl.dsl0.maxusdatarate='40000'

Using bridge mode with a dedicated PPPoE ethernet port
I use the AP on the device on my LAN, but I also use the modem purely in bridge mode, which means I want to dedicate a port to my router to allow it to do PPPoE to my ISP. It should also work with IPoE. Thankfully, standard OpenWRT config applies. I added a new bridge called ‘adsl_wan’ and added eth4, eth3, atm_8_35 and ptm0 to it:
config interface 'adsl_wan'
option type 'bridge'
option ip6hint '0'
option force_link '0'
list ifname 'eth4'
list ifname 'eth3'
list ifname 'atm_8_35'
list ifname 'ptm0'
You’ll need to remove eth3 from the LAN vlan. This gives you the port right next to the WAN ethernet (which is eth3 – eth4 is the WAN port) on the same bridge as the VDSL/ADSL modem. I have yet to figure out how to get the WAN port to do this – as it seems to be configured differently – maybe at the switch level.
In this configuration you can use the WiFi as an access point for your LAN as it's attached to the LAN bridge.
If you want to use the VOIP in the TG799 while in bridge mode, you will need to configure a default gateway, a nameserver, and configure the pabx to use the LAN bridge as the outgoing interface. The following example uses Google for DNS and assumes your router is at 10.0.0.254:
uci set network.lan.dns='8.8.8.8'
uci set network.lan.gateway='10.0.0.254'
uci set mmpbxrvsipnet.sip_net.interface='lan'
uci set mmpbxrvsipnet.sip_net.interface6='lan6'
uci commit
You can check the current running dns with cat /etc/resolv.conf
Enable web interface features in Bridge Mode
If you have the modem in bridge mode, the web interface is gutted compared to in routed mode.
Edit /www/lua/cards_limiter.lua
and change the following function to:
function M.card_limited(info, cardname)
## Display all cards.
return false
if info.bridged then
return not bridge_limit_list[cardname]
end
return false
end
Restart the web interface via: /etc/init.d/nginx restart
Note that to get out of bridged mode you will still have to factory reset (and possibly do the whole rooting procedure again) or find and reverse the config changes that were made to flick it into bridge mode.
Configuring multiple third party SIP providers
If you have multiple SIP accounts to log into – and with different providers, you can duplicate the entire sip_net section under a different name (very important, it will break VOIP completely otherwise) and configure as per above, or using the web interface. The web interface will see the section in the config once you add it in. It would be possible to add the section using UCI but it's quicker with an editor and you will get the most recent defaults from your existing profile rather than a stale web page!
SIP call routing
Each DECT device or FXS port can be registered against one or multiple SIP accounts. Look for the incoming_map section against sip_profile_0
and edit as needed. This should also be possible via the web interface after running the above default config which adds in a web page to allow editing this config. This is my setup to route sip_profile_1 to the first registered DECT device – and FXS port 1:
config incoming_map
option profile 'sip_profile_0'
list device 'fxs_dev_0'
list device 'dect_dev_1'
list device 'dect_dev_2'
list device 'dect_dev_3'
list device 'dect_dev_4'
list device 'dect_dev_5'
list device 'sip_dev_0'
list device 'sip_dev_1'
list device 'sip_dev_2'
list device 'sip_dev_3'
list device 'sip_dev_4'
list device 'sip_dev_5'
list device 'sip_dev_6'
config incoming_map
option profile 'sip_profile_1'
list device 'dect_dev_0'
list device 'fxs_dev_1'
Registering DECT handsets
There is a button on the modem you can hold for five seconds, or after enabling all the ‘cards’ via the web interface, the easy way is to start DECT paring via the web interface. Click on the Telephony card, then ‘Start’ the paring and follow the instructions for your handset. This was straight forward for me.
LAN SIP client use of the mini-PABX in the modem
It is possible to make calls out through the modem by registering as a SIP client. Clients 1 to 7 are configured and can be used like so for 1:
Username: 1
Password: <see below for finding the passwords>
Authentication User: phone1@telstra.gateway
To get a list of all the passwords set run this in SSH (noting that sip_dev_0 maps to phone1 etc):
uci show |grep mmpbxrvsipdev.sip_dev_..password

A serial console can be added using a 3.3v to RS232 adapter. These can be found on ebay quite cheaply. The serial console is J5 on the board, and note from the picture below, R327 and R328 need to be solder bridged to pass the serial signals to the adaptor. In the pictures shown, Black = Ground, Yellow = RX, and Green = TX.
Note that by default you can't log in on the serial console. If you want to enable this, edit /etc/inittab and change
#ttyS0::askfirst:/bin/login
to
ttyS0::askfirst:/bin/login
NAT ALG helpers
With the above changes you should now have a tile in the advanced GUI what allows you to change the settings for NAT ALGs.
<insert screenshot when I have one>
tcpdump is now in the diagnostics?
I was very happy to find this hidden gem.  Sadly there is no icon for it so I had to reuse one. Read the memory usage warnings before using it! I tested it once and file it provided opened up OK in WireShark.
Handy info for checking what's running in your modem
Checking what firmware is flashed and what is active:
find /proc/banktable -type f -print -exec cat {} ';'
What processes are running? (you should not see cmwpd etc on this list!)
ps
What programs are listening as network services?
netstat -tuplen
How much free space is there left for config files?
df -h
Can I see the full config? (be prepared for ~7700 lines of text hitting your console)
uci show
Can I filter that output for say just things with the word password in them?
uci show | grep password
What's that System Extras tab and what can I do in there?
You can turn on logging to an external syslog server. On windows run TFTPD64 (from http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html) and configure syslog in the settings. You can enable more logging in the VOIP subsystem by editing the logging config in /etc/config/mmpbx
You can trigger a PXE firmware upgrade to bank_1. This is only for advanced users! If you click this by accident you will have to wait for it to time out and reboot, or power cycle it while the orange light is flashing.
You can turn SSH access on/off from the LAN/WAN.
My firmware is so old that AutoFlashGUI can't authenticate to the modem!
This is because they changed the web authentication method to SRPv6 with firmware v15, and this is the only method that the AutoFlashGUI tool knows how to authenticate with.  You are going to have to flash the v16.3 .rbi file via sysupgrade after using the original manual procedure to get a shell.
Visit the ‘Diagnostics’ page on the modem, and click on the Ping & Traceroute tab. (If your modem doesn’t display the Diagnostics tile, factory reset the modem. The observation is that this only happens when the config is corrupted somehow.) In the IP address section, enter and run:
:::::::;echo root:root | chpasswd; dropbear -p 6666;
Give it 30 seconds to generate SSH host keys and then try to connect to your modem with SSH on port 6666 with root/root.
Copy the .rbi to a USB stick (FAT32 formatted is most likely to work on old firmware) and insert it into the modem.
If you type "cd /mnt/" and keep hitting tab it should eventually get to the end of the USB stick path, then hit enter. (You can also run 'mount' and try to work out the path the USB stick is mounted on, or 'dmesg' to check the system log to see if there was an error automatically mounting it.)
To be on the on the safe side we will copy the rbi to RAM, then flash it. Do the following with the correct .rbi name (keeping in mind that this is case sensitive):
cp filename.rbi /tmp
cd /tmp
sysupgrade filename.rbi
All things going well you should see it progress along and reboot, then you can commence the current procedure.
I want to factory reset 17.2 but I don't want to have to re-flash (aka Ghetto Reset!)
These modems use two roms (bank_1 and bank_2) which can be upgraded/used almost independently.  They are digital-signature verified before boot so you can't edit the rom image in the flash.  The config is stored in the matching folder in /overlay i.e. /overlay/bank_2 (hint: you can see your modified config files in here if you want to back stuff up or see what changes you made).  When a proper factory reset is done, the overlay partition is formatted (but not securely wiped).
To reset without doing an official reset, disconnect
your WAN connection (cwmpd will become acitve again temporarily), go into SSH and do the following:
rm -rf /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`
mkdir /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`
chmod 755 /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`
mkdir /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`/etc
chmod 775 /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`/etc
echo "echo root:root | chpasswd" > /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`/etc/rc.local
echo "dropbear -p 6666 &" >> /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`/etc/rc.local
chmod +x /overlay/`cat /proc/banktable/active`/etc/rc.local
sync
Wait 5 seconds and turn the modem's power off.  Ensure the WAN is disconnected!
Turn it back on and then resume the original procedure at "Setting up firmware v17.2".
I'm selling this modem, how do I securely wipe all the config?
Disconnect the WAN. Log in via SSH and run:
rm -rf /overlay/*;dd if=/dev/urandom of=/overlay/garbage bs=512;sync;rm /overlay/garbage;sync;
Wait until it has completed and turn the modem's power off.
Note that after this cwmpd will be active again so you could get upgraded against your will if it once it is connected to the internet again!
