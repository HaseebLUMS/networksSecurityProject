The ZyXEL USG Series is an all-in-one Unified Threat Management (UTM) solution that provides both robust network security and VPN connectivity for businesses of all sizes.

From the Manufacturer
Big Security for Small Businesses -Unified Security Gateway ZyWALL USG20W The ZyWALL USG50 is a Unified Security Gateway designed to provide complete, enterprise-level advanced security solutions to Small and Home Office networks, recommended for up to 10 PC users. Its flexible configuration is designed to help network administrators efficiently set up, manage, and enforce network security policies. The USG50 features a 180Mbps throughput ICSA certified SPI Firewall, and is designed with state of the art security features including a granular, easily manageable Content Filter; choice of ZyXEL or Kaspersky Anti-Virus; Anti-Spam; and IDP (Intrusion Detection and Prevention) for maximum network security. It also provides bandwidth management for QoS of VoIP, videoconferencing, and other important applications, as well as multiple-WAN Failover and Load Balancing. IPSec, SSL, and L2TP* VPN functionality allows telecommuters and home workers quick and easy access to corporate resources with most any device or network setup. Built with powerful Integrated High Performance Security architecture designed for Gigabit connections, a VPN throughput of 90Mbps, a UTM throughput of 24Mbps, up to 10,000 max sessions and 10 concurrent IPSec VPN tunnels, the USG50 has the power to monitor and protect even high-throughput networks without sacrificing performance. With 4x Gigabit LAN/DMZ and 2x Gigabit WAN interfaces you can load balance and failover multiple ISP links, allowing you to safeguard even the largest high-bandwidth environments.
Comprehensive threat protection with firewall, VPN, anti-virus** content filtering** anti-spam, and intrusion detection and prevention**to secure networks against front line threats.
Robust hybrid VPN (IPSec, SSL, and L2TP*)
Easily connect with mobile devices
IPv6 Support
QoS options for latency-sensitive applications
Compatible with Vantage Reporting and Management software 30day trial of the antivirus software
* Enabled by ZLD3.0 firmware upgrade** Yearly subscription required
Flexible, secure VPN options The USG50 is designed to allow secure VPN connections no matter what device or network settings are being used. IPSec VPN support allows secure connections to branch offices, partners, and headquarters; road warriors and telecommuters can use SSL to securely access the company network without having to install VPN software.
Easy Mobile Access The new ZLD3.0 firmware upgrade enables L2TP support on all USG devices, making it easy for Android, iOS, and other mobile devices to establish VPN tunnels to remote networks directly from their native settings. Comprehensive frontline threat protection The USG50 employs a comprehensive suite of security systems to proactively protect networks from threats before they ever reach networked devices.
ZyXEL’s anti-spam service eliminates spam, phishing, virus, and malware e-mail threats before they ever reach company inboxes while ensuring legitimate messages don’t get lost in the deluge.
Administrators can choose between BlueCoat and Commtouch web filtering services to allow administrators to quickly and easily block websites both by category and by specific URL in order to protect networks from inappropriate web traffic, as well as to prevent viruses and spyware from forcing computers on a protected network to ‘phone home,’ saving bandwidth and preventing security breaches.
ZyXEL’s signature-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention service allows network administrators granular control over the network functionality of specific applications while providing an added layer of defense from the most dangerous Trojans and backdoor applications on the internet today. With support for up to 2,500 signatures for the most common threats, IDP provides a powerful defense against threats to your network – both from the outside and from within.
Gateway virus protection acts as a first line of defense from the worst viruses and malware on the internet. A 24/7 service with constant updates, administrators can choose between ZyXEL’s ICSA-Certified anti-virus or Kaspersky’s award winning virus protection system to keep the most dangerous viruses and malware from ever reaching a protected network.
The USG50’s Content Filtering service is an integrated security system powered by an administrator’s choice of BlueCoat or Commtouch filtering services. The service is designed to allow administrators to quickly and easily block websites both by category and by specific URL in order to protect networks from inappropriate web traffic, as well as to prevent viruses and spyware from forcing computers on a protected network to ‘phone home,’ saving bandwidth and preventing security breaches.
IPv6 Ready With the advent of the new ZLD3.0 firmware, the USG50 is fully compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Full backward compatibility allows VPN tunnels to be created between networks newly upgraded to IPv6 and older IPv4 networks, ensuring a seamless transition and painless network upgrades. Network Optimization The USG50’s network optimization functionality makes it far more than a network security device. Support for multiple WANs allows the USG to load-balance and fail-over, protecting networks from congestion and downtime. Bandwidth management options let administrators prioritize latency-sensitive applications like VoIP and videoconferencing, ensuring high-quality connections without lag or performance issues. Vantage Management and Reporting The USG50 supports the use of ZyXEL’s Vantage CNM and Vantage Reporting software, allowing centralized management and monitoring of multiple ZyWALL devices on a single network. Vantage Reporting offers a comprehensive set of real-time and historical reports including firewall attacks, bandwidth usage, website usage, and more - all organized into an automated, easy-to-read format that can be viewed from anywhere. Administrators can use this data to easily identify security problems and their causes and take prompt action. Vantage CNM provides a suite of diagnostic and management tools that allows management of multiple ZyWALL devices from a centralized interface, reducing the time, cost, and complexity involved in VPN and security management. VPN monitoring allows network administrators to actively troubleshoot VPN problems as they occur, while centralized configuration of UTM functionality allows network administrators to manage license subscriptions, update devices, and isolate and repair security problems across all ZyWALL devices on a network.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. Please try again later.Some Guy1.0 out of 5 starsThis product is no longer fully supported by ZyXEL
December 18, 2015Style: ZWUSG20Verified PurchaseI have used it for years and they are very reliable but it hasn't received any recent updates from ZyXEL. With the latest PCI compliance rules, I can't get these devices to maintain compliance with the management interface enabled so I had to disable external management. As you can imagine, that makes life very difficult. Also, the web filtering is very easy to bypass by using HTTPS which is not filtered. For example, if I block *.facebook.com all a user needs to do is type https://facebook.com and completely bypass filtering. Not great.When I contact ZyXEL support, they say that this device is fully supported and not end of life however they recommend that I purchase a next gen device if I want the above fixed.

ST2.0 out of 5 starsAWESOME Features, But REALLY SLOW
November 22, 2015Style: ZWUSG20Verified PurchaseOk had it for a while now... WOW is this thing slow.
I have non stop issues with latency on this firewall. CPU and Mem never gets over 50% but it still hangs.
After a reboot can't take10-20 minutesto get back up.Plus dude:
features are fantastic.
UI is pretty good.
CLI is nice if you want it.
You REALLY need to spend some time going through all the menu's and getting a feel for all the groups, and categories and all that.
Dont change stuff until you go through it all.
Like all firewalls, take your time and configure it.
All the features I ever needed are there, just took me a bit to go through all of them.
I only have one problem and it's minimal, but needs to be noted.The enclosure/case is REALLY REALLY cheap.
The plastic feels like styrofoam or super brittle plastic.
I personally don't care because I sit it on a shelf and I will never touch it but they could invest a LITTLE BIT in the case.
I would pay an extra $20 to get aluminum or metal or some sort so it's stackable or atleast doesnt feel like it would shatter if it got bumped!
I would NOT stack anything near this guy and if you think it might move or be moved often... this thing is NOT rugged!

Amazon Customer3.0 out of 5 starsProduct good but BEWARE of gimmicky registration and non-responsive customer service.
October 7, 2016Style: ZWUSG50Verified PurchaseI'd give five stars for the product itself. Having set up several routers, I was able to set this up the way I wanted, even though the terminology was different. And, so far, it seems to do exactly what I want it to.On the other hand, trying to register it through ZyXEL's procedure doesn't work at all. The process requires visiting portal.myzyxel.com and setting up an account. I did that and received a popup stating, "You will receive an email with instructions on how to confirm your email address in a few minutes." That was yesterday morning.After waiting about six hours and having clicked on the "Resend Confirmation" link several times, I submitted a request to ZyXEL customer service. Several hours later I received an email response from Miguel, saying, "We check on our system the e-mail address that you provided and still shows unconfirmed. Please check your spam, junk or any other firewall folder on your e-mail that may be preventing you from receiving the confirmation e-mail."Well, yes, it is unconfirmed because I never received the instructions telling me how to confirm it. And I don't have a spam folder or a junk folder or any other firewall folder that would prevent me from receiving the confirmation email.Interestingly, I registered two switches with ZyXEL at the same time yesterday. These do not "qualify" for the special myzyxel registration , so I registered them over the web. I immediately received confirmation emails for both of them. I also received Miguel's email. So I wonder why my system would be suspected of trapping the confirmation email for the USG 50.I did reply to Miguel last night and, not surprisingly, have heard nothing back. In the meantime I have waited over 28 hours for their gimmicky registration process to process my registration.

Ted5.0 out of 5 starsNice step up from the typical home/office router
January 17, 2014Style: ZWUSG50Verified PurchaseThe USG 50 is a nice step up from the typical home/office routers I've owned in the past. I purchased this device because the D-Link
wireless router I had installed in my restaurant appeared overwhelmed with the traffic created by my guests and the 12 IP cams on my network. I needed to reboot the D-Link unit each morning. I've yet to reboot the USG 50 in over a month.The big difference between this device and the typical router is the incredible flexibility, multiple wired networks, multiple WANS
and much improved security it offers. The down side to all this a much more difficult setup. I was very well versed in setting up Netgear, D-Link and Linksys routers, but this device is much more complicated and confusing to setup compared to the others. If like me, you're
comfortable with these other small office/home routers, be prepared for a bit of a learning curve.Once you begin to understand the different configuration routine, the device becomes much easier to use and configure.PROS:Reasonable price for features/build quality.Good built-in security features.Offers incredible flexibility for multiple LANS/WANS and VPN settings.Very strong tech support from ZyXEL.Handles much more data, users and different networks compared to other, less capable devices.CONS:Difficult to configure for the average person.Some features work only for 30 days (Trial versions of ADP, content filter, anti-spam, anti-virus and IDP signature)After a month of problem free usage, I decided to purchase another sample for my second location.The few calls I placed to ZyXEL were answered fairly quickly with competent staff on the other end.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this unit to others.

Overview:
Security on a New Level - The Future Is Ahead. Stay Ahead with Zyxel USGs.
As broadband quickly becomes a necessity in the business world facing network security threats, the breaches evolve into highly sophisticated attacks to paralyze networks and to steal sensitive information. In response to such attacks, small businesses have to meet the great challenge protecting their networks.
The Zyxel USG Series is designed for small business to provide real-time inspection and multi-layer network protection to prevent the network from threats. The USG Series embodies Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI) Firewall, Anti-Virus (AV), Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP), Content Filtering, Anti-Spam and VPN (IPSec/SSL/L2TP) features in one box. In addition, the USG Series not only offers complete security license to fulfill your demand but also guarantees the continuous firmware upgrades to save your cost. Incorporating comprehensive security features in the connected devices, the USG Series safeguards your organization’s customer and company records, intellectual properties as well as critical resources from both external and internal threats.
Robust security without sacrificing performance
Comprehensive support to IPv6
Robust hybrid VPN (IPSec/SSL/2TP)
Zero-configuration remote access with easy VPN
Support L2TP VPN on mobile device (iPhone and Android phone)
ICSA Firewall, IPSec certification
Content filter stops malware and Web threats
Powerful Email security
Non-stop Internet access with multiple WAN and 3G backups
Benefits:
Robust security without sacrificing performance
The Zyxel USG 20/20W/50/100/100-PLUS/200 Series is built with a powerful Integrated High-Performance Security architecture that provides real-time inspection to prevent networks from threats without sacrificing performance. Corporate networks are not only flawlessly secured but also get significant performance enhancements on productivity and efficiency since file loading, emailing and information searching applications are processed at higher speeds.
Comprehensive IPv6 support smoothly connects future-ready networks
The Zyxel USG Series is IPv6-ready today and is certified with “IPv6 Ready” gold logo. With IPv6 feature enabled, the USG Series ensures businesses with a smooth migration path from the IPv4-based networks to the full IPv6 infrastructure. It assigns IPv6 addresses to clients and passes the IPv6 traffics through the IPv4 environment. The USG Series supports dual-stack and IPv4 tunneling (6rd and 6to4 transition tunnel) implementations for Internet connectivity to access IPv6 applications.
EASY VPN reduces operation cost and time
Establishing a VPN tunnel is a good way to build secure connections among remote offices, branch offices and partners; however it is difficult for non-technical employees, such as sales people, to use because of complicated configuration. The Zyxel USG Series is equipped with the “EASY VPN” solution to push configuration files to the VPN clients automatically; this eliminates the configuration efforts while securing the access at the same time. In addition, the USG Series supports L2TP VPN technology on iPhones, Android phones and many other mobile devices as L2TP VPN enables employees in remote places to connect to the headquarters with easy and free access.
Content filter for safer Web surfing
The World Wide Web has become the main target for network threats, since the Internet itself is a very effective malware delivery mechanism. With threats hidden directly in contents such as cookies, add-ons and rootkits, it makes malware exceptionally difficult to detect.
The Zyxel USG Series content filter solution provided by Blue Coat and Commtouch, the leading providers, reduces costs and extends protection by combining a comprehensive, integrated database featuring millions of URLs, IP addresses and domains. With the solution, the USG Series not only enables real-time protection that deters emerging Web threats including malware and phishing, but also blocks or monitors certain sites to maintain employee productivity.
Powerful Email security
The Zyxel USG Series delivers industry-leading protection, powered by Commtouch, against spam, phishing and virus-laden emails. The extremely high performance of Commtouch technology comes from the unique recurrent pattern detection (RPD) mechanism that possesses its superior capability through analyzing millions of new patterns each day (24x7x365) to block all the associated messages real-time. In addition, the Zyxel USG applies sender-based IP reputation to remove over 80% of unwanted mails and to take advantage of the zero-hour virus outbreak protection feature, which is capable of blocking or delaying suspicious messages hours before commercial anti-virus signatures are available.
More 3G card support
The Zyxel USG Series not only supports multiple WAN ports but also 3G networks through USB or PC cards. With 3G connections, the USG Series enables load sharing or failover to deliver highly reliable network connectivity; it also supports more 3G cards with generic driver to ensure excellent interoperability. Since the customers don’t have to purchase specific 3G cards to save cost.

High performance
The Zyxel USG Series is built with a powerful Integrated High Performance Security architecture. It provides real-time inspection to prevent networks from threats without sacrificing performance. Take the USG 50 as an example: its excellent performance delivers sufficient speed boost to meet all small business needs.
EASY VPN — zero configuration remote access
When establishing VPN tunnels, it could be quite difficult for non-technical employees to use due to the complicated configuration.
The Zyxel USG Series is equipped with the “EASY VPN” solution to push configuration files to the VPN clients automatically; this eliminates the configuration efforts while securing the access at the same time.
Content Filter stops malware and Web threats
The Zyxel USG Content Filter enables businesses to protect their users and networks from malware and abuse such as spyware, phishing attacks and inappropriate P2P or IM usage. It keeps office computers from getting infected by dangerous malware and comprehensively protects business network environments.
Non-stop Internet access with multiple WAN and 3G backups
The Zyxel USG supports not only WAN traffic load balancing to increase the overall network throughput but also flexible 3G backup as a WAN alternative to enhance network reliability.

Security on a New Level - The Future Is Ahead. Stay Ahead with Zyxel USGs.
Utilizing networks to access internal and external mission-critical applications are common, and important as well, for small and medium-sized businesses. As faster networks bring more convenience and efficiency, businesses are facing challenges from sophisticated attacks and even cybercrime that would cause interrupted communications, degraded performance and loss of valuable information; however traditional firewalls are not capable of protecting business from such network attacks.
The Zyxel USG 300/1000/2000 Series are security platforms that offers ultra-high performance, deep packet inspection and all-in-one multi-threat protection not only to block the latest attack combinations including intrusion attempts, viruses, worms, phishing, spyware, spam and many other malware types effectively, but also to secure remote access among branch offices, partners and customers. The USG’s real-time threat detection and continuous update services provide the fastest response speed in the networking industry to deter the evolving security threats before the business is affected. The Zyxel USG 300/1000/2000 Series is ideal for small- and medium-size businesses to safeguard their network environments.

Benefits:
Ultra-high performance and protection to secure business networks
The Zyxel USG 300/1000/2000 Series delivers wire-speed performance and integrated threat management for wired networks. The USG Series provides firewall throughputs of from 350 Mbps to 2 Gbps that enables businesses to protect critical applications and networks without affecting availability or performance. In addition, the USG’s unique built-in clean-traffic architecture can prevent risks such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, spyware, phishing attacks and other emerging Internet threats. In short, the architecture can assure clean and secure network environments for business users.
Comprehensive IPv6 support to ensure investment protection
The Zyxel USG Series is IPv6-ready today and is certified with “IPv6 Ready” gold logo. With IPv6 feature enabled, the USG Series ensures businesses with a smooth migration path from the IPv4-based networks to the full IPv6 infrastructure. It assigns IPv6 addresses to clients and passes the IPv6 traffics through the IPv4 environment. The USG Series supports dual-stack and IPv4 tunneling (6rd and 6to4 transition tunnel) implementations for Internet connectivity to access IPv6 applications. The comprehensive IPv6 features built into the USG Series ensure not only future-ready connectivity but also investment protection for businesses.IPv6 applications.
Various VPN solutions to simplify secure access
Establishing VPN tunnels is a good solution to provide a safe way to access necessary network resources remotely with any device anytime, anywhere. However due to the complicated configuration, it could be quite difficult for non-technical employees such as sales people to use. The Zyxel USG Series is equipped with the “EASY VPN” solution to push configuration files to the VPN clients automatically; this eliminates the configuration efforts while securing the access at the same time. In addition, the USG Series supports L2TP VPN technology on iPhones, Android phones and many other mobile devices as L2TP VPN enables employees in remote places to connect to the headquarters with easy and free access.
Real-time, dynamic malware protection to safeguard business networks
Web security powered by BlueCoat and Commtouch
With more valuable information being placed on the data cloud, impacts from the ever-growing cybercrime should be treated seriously. As modern malware become very sophisticated and difficult to repel, the USG’s content filter from Blue Coat and Commtouch, the leading solution provider, reduces costs and extends protection by integrating a comprehensive, continuously updated database featuring millions of URLs, IP addresses and domains. With the content filter, the USG Series not only enables real-time protection to deter emerging Web threats including malware, phishing and Zombies/bots, but also monitors or blocks certain sites to maintain employee productivity.
Email security powered by Commtouch
The Zyxel USG Series delivers industry-leading protection, powered by Commtouch, against spam, phishing and virus-laden emails. The extremely high performance of Commtouch technology comes from the unique recurrent pattern detection (RPD) mechanism that possesses its superior capability through analyzing millions of new patterns each day (24x7x365) to block all the associated messages real-time. In addition, the USG applies sender-based IP reputation to remove over 80% of unwanted mails and to take advantage of the zero-hour virus outbreak protection feature, which is capable of blocking or delaying suspicious messages hours before commercial anti-virus signatures are available.
High Availability (HA) ensures non-stop business operations
Loss of mission-critical connection can cause serious, and sometimes disastrous, consequences to businesses. The Zyxel USG 300/1000/2000 Series provides HA features to guarantee a secure, reliable connection between the protected network and the Internet.
Multiple WAN ports and configurable load balancing between ports.
An auxiliary (backup) Internet connection known as out-of-band management.
A backup USG in case the master USG fails (Device HA).

Application Diagram:
USG clean-traffic architecture
The USG’s clean-traffic architecture protects against network risks such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, spyware, phishing attacks and other emerging Internet threats. With the clean-traffic architecture, enterprises users are assured to have clean and secure network environments.
EASY VPN — zero configuration remote access
When establishing VPN tunnels, it could be quite difficult for non-technical employees to use due to the complicated configuration.
The Zyxel USG Series is equipped with the “EASY VPN” solution to push configuration files to the VPN clients automatically; this eliminates the configuration efforts while securing the access at the same time.
Content Filter stops malware and Web threats
The Zyxel USG Content Filter enables businesses to protect their users and networks from malware and abuse such as spyware, phishing attacks and inappropriate P2P or IM usage. It keeps office computers from getting infected by dangerous malware and comprehensively protects business network environments.
Granular control over social networking applications
Social networking applications such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have become an Internet phenomenon allowing people to quickly connect and share information with each other. However, social networking applications could eclipse business productivity considerably without flexible management. The Zyxel USG Series prevents the Internet connection from being abused to minimize bandwidth waste or human resource policy violations. The USG Series provides granular control over the usage of social networking applications.
