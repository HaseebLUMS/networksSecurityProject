• Making an IP call without the intervention of a proxy server is called peer to
peer calling
• As peer to peer calling does not require a proxy server, voice communication
using this application can be done virtually free of cost
• The major cost savings offered by this application makes it a very attractive
mode of inter – branch or intra – office voice communication

• PIN authentication is a security feature to restrict access to the system and
prevent possible misuse of resources
• User can use the PIN authentication on the source port to establish identity of
callers before their call is processed by SETU VFXTH
• PIN authentication can be used on the source port only if the incoming call
routing for the source port is set to After answering the call and collecting digits
• To use this feature it must be enabled on the source port and the PIN
authentication table must be configured
PIN Authentication
131.
• The PIN authentication table stores up to 500 PIN numbers and their
corresponding authentication passwords
• If PIN authentication is enabled on source port, SETU VFXTH answers the
Incoming call and plays a feature tone, it waits for the caller to dial the PIN
number and password, it matches them with the PIN authentication table, if
match is found it allows the call to be processed
• In case of wrong PIN entered, SETU VFXTH allows the caller to make two more
attempts, if the caller fails to dial correct PIN and password in all attempts, the
system disconnects the call

• Digest authentication is a challenge – based authentication service of SIP to
authenticate the identity of the originator of SIP request in the INVITE message
• The recipient of the request can ascertain whether or not the originator of the
request is authorized to make the request
• When the digest credentials of the originator – User Name and Password – in
the INVITE message are authenticated and accepted by the recipient, the
originator and recipient are connected
• You may use the digest authentication to restrict access to SETU VFXTH to
specific callers, prevent unwanted or malicious calls
Digest Authentication
135.
• When this feature is enabled on a SIP trunk for all Incoming calls
1. SETU VFXTH will challenge the identity of the calling party
2. When the calling party sends its credentials, SETU VFXTH authenticates the

• Prefix to domain name conversion is used when a user sets call forward or
makes a blind transfer on SIP, this feature is applicable only when the
destination port is SIP
• SETU VFXTH supports multiple SIP trunks & FXS ports, when a FXS port user dials
a SIP number, SETU VFXTH routes the call to the IP network using the SIP trunk
determined by the routing mechanism. The FXS user can dial only numbers not
domain names, therefore it becomes necessary that the domain names be
assigned prefix codes which the FXS user can dial
Prefix to Domain Name Conversion
141.
• User need to program prefix v/s domain name in the table
• This table is not checked for making an outgoing call, but it is checked when
some FXS port has set call forward and only number is programmed or user is
doing blind transfer
• For example prefix in the table is programmed as *123 and domain name as
abc.com and destination number for call forward is *1239974 then it will be
replaced by 9974@abc.com

Certificate
187.
Certificate
• SETU VFXTH supports certification for TLS, Web Server, Firmware Upgrade,
Configuration Upgrade and TR-069.
• SETU VFXTH supports two types of Certificates: Self-Signed Certificate and CA
Signed Certificate.
188.
Self – Signed Certificate
• A self-signed certificate is created by the clients themselves or by the Servers and
then given to their clients.
• It means that you yourself become the Certificate Authority (CA), create a CA
Certificate and sign it.
• The self-signed certificate is faster to create but is not signed by a trusted CA
Organization.
• The self-signed certificate must be installed in the trusted list of clients that
connects over TLS with the Server. Because the certificate has been self signed, the
signature is not likely to be in the clients’ trust file, hence, they need to add it.
189.
Certificate
Generate self signed CA
certificate by entering the
required details below
Once you generate self-signed certificate, you must send it to your clients so that
they install it in their trusted list.
Click generate
to generate new
certificate for
entered details
190.
Certificate
System will show
generated
certificates under
trusted root CA
191.
System Certificate
• After creating a Self-Signed CA Certificate, you can either,
• Generate a System Certificate for your clients. These System Certificates can
then be given to the respective clients OR
• The Clients can prepare their own System Certificates. For this you need to
send them the CA Certificate created by you OR
• Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), if you want the Certificate to be
signed by a third party
If the clients prepare their own certificates, you need to send your CA Certificate to
all the clients. The clients must upload the same in their system. Similarly, all the
clients must send their CA Certificates to you and you must upload the same in
your system. To avoid this, it is recommended that you create the Certificates and
then provide it to your clients
192.
Enter details to
generate system
certificate
If you want to get a CA Signed Certificate, you need to do
the following:
1. Generate and enroll the Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
2. Get the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) verified and
signed by the Certified Authority (CA).

1 Proxy Server Introduction2 Table of Contents 1 General Introduction Proxy+SDK Proxy Application Development...63 1 General Introduction The mobile device usually adopts the wireless 3G network, the central software can not connect to the mobile device. It needs the mobile device to send out the connection request and then register to the central software. In this case, the central software is acting as the server. For the software development, you can not directly call the Login interface to establish the connection to the device as you connect to the DVR. Here we develop the proxy server software to allow the software to connect to the mobile device conveniently so that you can use the proxy+general SDk solutions to connect to the mobile device. If your software has connected to our DVR in the past, then you can connect to the mobile device without modifying the code.4 2 Proxy+SDK You can refer to the following diagram for proxy+sdk blueprint information. Mobile Device (Plate 1) Virtual Device (Plate 1) Transmis sion Client-end server and etc Virtual Device Mobile Device (Plate n) PSS (Plate n) Proxy PC Mobile device: For each mobile device, you can set one unique ID such as the plate. You can use the 3G network to connect to the virtual device (plate 1) of the proxy server. Please note the proxy server PC need to use the public IP address. PC: The proxy software and the user transmission server are running on the PC. You can add multiple virtual devices to the proxy server and use the plate to identify each virtual device too. Now, the mobile device can establish the connection to the corresponding virtual device. For the virtual device, it has its listening port such as the (Just like a DVR). The user transmission server or the PSS can use our network SDK to login the virtual device. For the network SDK, it has the same interface as you login the DVR. You can visit our website to download the network SDK. You can see there are detailed development document and a series of DEMO. You can use the proxy server to begin the 2 nd development to embed the proxy server to your own platform applications. For this kind of proxy setup, you can read the information from the database and set the proxy.5 3 Proxy The proxy server packet includes the dynamic library and applications. Double click the application; you can see an interface is shown as below. See Figure 1. You can view the virtual devices and their corresponding statues in the device list. If you want to embed the proxy server to your own applications so that you can set the proxy server in the database, please call the DvrProxyServer.h of DvrProxyServer.dll from the development packet. Figure 16 4 Application Development The application can use the network SDK to login the proxy server. For example: Login interface: LONG CLIENT_Login( char *pchdvrip, WORD wdvrport, char *pchusername, char *pchpassword, LPNET_DEVICEINFO lpdeviceinfo, int *error = 0 ); There is communication between the software and the mobile device if the login call is success. Then you can use this login handle to monitor, view the GPS information and etc. The IP and the port of the interface are referring to the listening IP and port of virtual device of the proxy server. You can use the unique ID (usually it is the plate) to establish the connection. Monitor interface: LONG CLIENT_RealPlay( LONG lloginid, int nchannelid, HWND hwnd, ); GPS upload interface: void CLIENT_SetSubcribeGPSCallBack( fgpsrev OnGPSMessage, DWORD dwuser ); struct GPS_Info{ NET_TIME revtime; char DvrSerial[50]; double longitude; double latidude; double height; double angle; double speed;7 WORD BOOL BOOL }; starcount; antennastate; orientationstate; Note This manual is for reference only. Slight difference may be found in the user interface. All the designs and software here are subject to change without prior written notice. If there is any uncertainty or controversy, please refer to the final explanation of ours. Please visit our website or contact your local service engineer for more information.
