I need to transfer and download file using ftp for my personal website. Can you provide me a list of FTP commands that may be sent to an FTP server, to upload and download files using UNIX / Linux ftp command line client?
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a network protocol used to copy a file from one computer to another over the Internet or LAN. FTP follows a client-server architecture which utilizes separate control and data connections between the ftp client and server. The default port for ftp is 21.Adblock detected 😱My website is made possible by displaying online advertisements to my visitors. I get it! Ads are annoying but they help keep this website running. It is hard to keep the site running and producing new content when so many people block ads. Please consider donating money to the nixCraft via PayPal/Bitcoin, or become a supporter using Patreon.
WARNING! These examples uses outdated insecure ftp protocol / client and if executed you are open to various attacks including password snooping. I strongly recommend that you use sftp, the secure version of FTP. Just type sftp instead of ftp and all of the following commands should work with sftp client too.ftp: Internet File Transfer ProgramUse the following syntax to connect to transfer files to and from a remote network ftp site:ftp ftp.example.com
ftp 1.2.3.4
ftp user@ftp.example.comYou must know ftp username and password for user-based password authentication or with anonymous user access use ftp as both username and password. In this example, you are connecting to ftp.freebsd.org with anonymous user access (open the terminal and type the following command): $ ftp ftp.freebsd.org Sample session:Trying 87.51.34.132...

However, to find out the pathname of the current directory on the remote ftp server, enter: ftp> pwd
Sample outputs:Remote directory: /pub/FreeBSDTask: Download Multiple FilesYou need to use mget command as follows to copy multiple files from the remote ftp server to the local system. You may be prompted for a yes/no (Y/N) answer before transferring each file (you can disable prompt by passing the -i option to ftp client). To download all files, enter: ftp> mget * To download all perl files (ending with .pl extension), enter: ftp> mget *.plTask: Turn On / Off Interactive PromptingThe ftp command prompt sets interactive prompting; “on” which enables prompting so that you can verify of each step of the multiple commands, “off” allows the commands to act unimpeded: ftp> prompt on ftp> mput *.php ftp> prompt off
ftp> mget *.pyTask: Delete FileTo delete a file in the current remote directory use delete command: ftp> delete fileName ftp> delete output.jpg Task: Upload One FileTo copy one file at a time from the local systems to the remote ftp server, enter: ftp> put fileName In this example, upload logo.jpg, enter: ftp> put logo.jpgTask: Upload Multiple FilesTo copy multiple files from the local system to the remote ftp server use mput command. Again, you may be prompted for a yes/no (y/n) answer before transferring each file. In this example, upload all files from the current system: ftp> mput * ftp> mput *.plTask: Create a DirectoryTo make a new directory, enter: ftp> mkdir dirName ftp> mkdir scripts ftp> cd scripts ftp> pwdTask: Delete a DirectoryTo remove or delete a directory, enter: ftp> rmdir dirName ftp> rmdir images ftp> lsTask: Set The Mode Of File TransferTo set the mode of file transfer to ASCII, enter: ftp> ascii Please note that ascii is the default and good for text files. To set the mode of file transfer to binary, enter: ftp> binary The binary mode is recommended for almost all sort of files including images, zip files and much more. The binary mode provides less chance of a transmission error.Task: Connect To Another FTP ServerTo open a connection with another ftp server, enter: ftp> open ftp.nixcraft.net.in The above command opens a new FTP connection with ftp.nixcraft.net.in. You must provide a username and password for a ftp.nixcraft.net.in account. However, a username and password can be skipped for an anonymous FTP connection.Task: Exit the FTP SessionType quit or bye, enter: ftp> quit OR ftp> bye Sample outputs:221 Goodbye.How Do I Find Out More Information About The FTP Commands?Type ? or help to get more information about the FTP commands: ftp> ? ftp> help Sample outputs:Commands may be abbreviated.

The prompt feature of the mput command can be disabled by invoking ftp with the -i option. In this instance, all file names that match the pattern in your mput command will be transferred without confirmation. Carlos Rodrigues says:

Abstract
Multicast DNS will not normally extend beyond the MAC Bridge.
This
limitation is problematic when desired services are beyond the reach
of multicast mDNS.
This document explores security considerations
when overcoming this limitation.

Introduction
On Bridged LANs, as described by [IEEE.802-1D.2004], MAC entities
make their services known via multicast.
Multicast forms a basis for
networking and layer 3 protocol initialization where [mDNS] together
with [DNS-SD] provide a higher level of structure based on multicast
announcements made within a LAN environment.
Unfortunately, an
increased exchange of structural information does not scale well.
There is an effort to push mDNS into DNS.
Just exposure of [mDNS] to
the Internet has proven problematic as noted by [CERTvu550620].
[DNS-SD] can further extend DDoS amplification concerns. [mDNS] may
use Jumbo frames of 9000 bytes that exceeds design limits of Ethernet
CRC, however it recommends an upper limit of 1,300 bytes suitable for
most local networks.
DNS started with in an era working within the
minimum MTU established by [RFC0791] and noted by [RFC1191] of 576
bytes which accommodates 512 byte UDP DNS messages.
Most Internet
links are able to handle larger MTUs, as per the minimum 1280 byte
MTU specified by [RFC2460] for IPv6.
[DNS-SD] discovery is initialized by querying DNS PTR queries using
Unicast or Multicast DNS at five special zones reserved for this
purpose:
b._dns-sd._udp..
Domain list to Browse
db._dns-sd._udp..
Default Domain to Browse
r._dns-sd._udp..
Domains list to register service
dr._dns-sd._udp..
Default Domain to register service
lb._dns-sd._udp..
Legacy Browse using special label info
SRV [RFC2782] records are located with the form:
"_._.
DNS-SD differs by locating SRV and TXT RR-sets with the forms:
_._...
._._...
._sub._._...
Instance names are not host names and may use Unicode for Network
Interchange [RFC5198] encoding and may include escaped periods "\."

For DNS-SD, Proto="udp" for all non-TCP transports otherwise it is

_ = IANA Registered Service Name
At each of these locations SRV and TXT Resource Record Sets offer
instance and service enumerations but resulting RR-sets may be
unsuitable for exposure to the Internet.
The RR-sets returned in
response to a wildcard placed at the instance location can approach
839 instances and 64 kBytes.
In addition, a browsing operation never
completes until terminated where clients are expected to report
availability state changes.
The DNS-SD query to response ratio makes
it potentially unsuitable for access over the Internet.
A Bridge acts as an interconnect mechanism transparent to end
stations on LANs.
Bridges designated to forward frames is normally
accomplished by participation in a Spanning Tree Algorithm.
Many
expect [mDNS] resource records can be safely and automatically placed
into [DNS] to overcome Bridge to Bridge multicast limitations.
Nevertheless, such a process must operate in conjunction with
requisite controls necessary to retain network security.
A Bridge forwards frames based on prior source MAC associations with
incoming frames on different LAN ports.
Source MAC and LAN port
associations are recommended to expire in 300 seconds.
Frames
containing source multicast MACs are silently discarded as invalid.
Frames containing a destination MAC on the same LAN port already
associated with the MAC are silently discarded.
A valid incoming
frame with a destination not previously associated with a different
LAN port is forwarded (flooded) to all other LAN ports, otherwise
when a MAC destination address is associated with a different LAN
port from which the frame was received, the frame is selectively
forwarded to this port.
All broadcast and multicast MACs are flooded
to all other LAN ports because they do not represent a valid source.
Flooding operations may create a storm of replicated frames having an
unknown MAC destination whenever forwarding is enabled on LAN ports
connected in a loop.
In [IEEE.802-11.2012] wireless networks, multicast frames are
transmitted at a low data rate supported by all receivers.
Multicast
on wireless networks may thereby lower overall network throughput.
Some network administrators block some multicast traffic or convert
it to a series of link-layer unicast frames.
Wireless links may be orders of magnitude less reliable than their
wired counterparts.
To improve transmission reliability,
[IEEE.802-11.2012] requires positive acknowledgement of unicast
frames.
It does not, however, support positive acknowledgement of

multicast frames.
As a result, it is common to observe much higher
loss of multicast frames on wireless compared against wired network
technologies.

IANA Considerations
This document requires no IANA consideration.
3.
Security Considerations
Scalable DNS-SD (SSD) proposes to automatically gather autonomously
named [mDNS] resource records by observing announcement traffic to
then make routable resources visible and accessible from other
networks via unicast [DNS] structured per [DNS-SD].
When doing so,
address translation using Unique Local Addresses, ULAs [RFC4193] can
offer a significant level of protection since typical link-local
addresses are not usable from other networks but either ULA or
[RFC1918] addresses typically indicate site local.
Section 3.2 of
[RFC4193] are locally defined and handled as Global addresses
although not intended to be routed beyond the site or beyond those
having explicit routing agreements.
Section 4.1 of [RFC4193] indicates the default behavior of exterior
routing protocol sessions between administrative routing regions must
be to ignore receipt of and not advertise prefixes in the FC00::/7
block.
A network operator may specifically configure prefixes longer
than FC00::/7 for inter-site communication.
Specifically, these
prefixes are not designed to aggregate.
Routers by default do not
block ULA prefixes which makes it important to confirm how ULA
traffic is handled by the access provider.
ULA or [RFC1918] addresses are not normally routed over the Internet
where their use provides a degree of isolation.
For either home or
enterprise networks, ULAs as an overlay network avoids network
address translations and permits local routing isolated from direct
Internet access.
ULAs also permit local communications to remain
unaffected by Internet related link failures or scope limitations
imposed by use of multicast protocols.
ULAs avoid a need to renumber internal-only private nodes when
changing ISPs, or when ISPs restructure their address allocations.
In these situations, use of ULA offers an effective tool for
protecting internal-only nodes.
As such, more than just the security
considerations discussed in [mDNS] and [DNS-SD] are needed.
For
example, [DNS-SD] states the following: "Since DNS-SD is just a
specification for how to name and use records in the existing DNS, it

has no specific additional security requirements over and above those
that already apply to DNS queries and DNS updates."
This simply
overlooks that many devices are not automatically published in DNS
nor can it be assumed they are able to handle the access that DNS
might permit.
[DNS-SD] recommends additional DNS records such as the associated PTR
and TXT SHOULD be generated to improve network efficiency for both
Unicast and Multicast DNS-SD responses.
This behavior further
increases risks related to query/response ratios and the likelihood
security sensitive information might become exposed.
Current BTMM [RFC6281] only publishes ULAs of hosts in DNS able to
authenticate when setting up an overlay network.
Remaining devices,
such as printers, are only accessed as shared elements offered by the
authenticating hosts.
DNS resources should never be considered to
offer privacy even in split-horizon configurations.
DNS is unable to
authenticate incoming queries nor can it offer application layer
protection.
Since many prefixes are expected to be in use within
environments served by [I-D.cheshire-dnssd-hybrid], errors related to
network boundary detections becomes critical.
As such, DNS SHOULD
NOT publish addresses of devices unable to authenticate sessions that
traverse the Internet.
[DNS-SD] should not be viewed as only a catalog structure of desired
services.
[I-D.cheshire-dnssd-hybrid] is to be used to bridge
adjacent networks, which risks conveying resources of hosts that are
unable to safely facilitate Internet access.
Since
[I-D.cheshire-dnssd-hybrid] only expects to disclose routable
addresses while also ignoring use of ULAs, this clearly expects
conveyance of globally routable addresses, GUA.
Use of ULAs instead
of GUAs represents a significantly safer strategy that permits
limited devices to remain isolated from the Internet while still
allowing packet routing between local network realms.
[I-D.cheshire-dnssd-hybrid] lacks a process able to limit resources
being gathered, resolved, and propagated to those that can be
administrated.
As such, an [I-D.cheshire-dnssd-hybrid] scheme
represents a profound change to network security.
The following
sections highlight potential threats posed by deploying [DNS-SD] over
multiple links through the automated collection and publication of
[mDNS] resources into [DNS] as proposed by
[I-D.cheshire-dnssd-hybrid].
This conveyance expands namespaces into
.local., .sitelocal., and [DNS] which may also cache Internet
namespace.
This new routable namespace also lacks the benefit of registrar
involvement and may not afford an administrator an ability to

mitigate nefarious activity, such as spoofing and phishing, without
requisite controls having been first carefully established.
When a
device has access to different realms on multiple interfaces, it is
not even clear how simple conflict resolution avoids threatening
network stability while resolving names conveyed over disparate
technologies.
Managing autonomously named resources becomes especially salient
since visually selected names are not ensured uniquely represented
nor quickly resolved due to latency uncertainties.
For example,
[DNS] recommends 5 second timeouts with a doubling on two subsequent
retries for a total of 35 seconds. [mDNS] only requires compliance
with [RFC5198] rather than IDNA2008 [RFC5895].
This less restrictive
use of the name space may impair the defense of critical services
from look-alike attack. [mDNS] does not ensure instances are visually
unique and allows spaces and punctuation not permitted by IDNA2008.
It is imperative for SSD to include requisite filtering necessary to
prevent data ex-filtration or the interception of sensitive services.
Any exchanged data must first ensure locality, limit the resources
gathered, resolved, and propagated to just those elements that can be
effectively administrated.
It is critical to ensure normal network
protection is not lost for hosts that depend on link-local addressing
and exclusion of routable traffic.
A printer would be one such
example of a host that can not be upgraded.
3.1.
Multiple Link Strategies
3.1.1.
Selective Forwarding based on IGMP or MLD snooping
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376] supports
multicast on IPv4 networks.
Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)
[RFC3810] supports multicast management on IPv6 networks using ICMPv6
messaging in contrast to IGMP's bare IP encapsulation.
This
management allows routers to announce their multicast membership to
neighboring routers.
To optimize which LANs receive forwarded
multicast frames, IGMP or MLD snooping can be used to determine the
presence of listeners as a means to permit selective forwarding of
multicast frames as well.
3.1.2.
IPv4 Link-Local
[RFC3927] provides an overview of IPv4 address complexities related
to dealing with multiple segments and interfaces.
IPv6 introduces
new paradigms in respect to interface address assignments which offer
scoping as explained in [RFC4291].

3.1.3.
VLAN
Use of VLAN such as [RFC5517] can selectively extend multicast
forwarding beyond Bridge limitations.
While not a general solution,
use of VLAN can both isolate and unite specific networks.
3.1.4.
DHCP
IP address assignment and host registration might use a single or
forwarded DHCP [RFC2131] or [RFC3315] server for IPv4 and IPv6
respectively that responds to interconnected networks as a means to
register hosts and addresses.
DHCP does not ensure against name or
address conflict nor is it intended to configure routers.
3.1.5.
Automated placement of mDNS resources into DNS
IP addresses made visible by [DNSSEC] or [DNS] that conform with
[DNS-SD] might be used, but the automated population of information
into [DNS] should be limited to administrative systems.
Automated conversion of [mDNS] into unicast [DNS] can be problematic
from a security standpoint as can the widespread propagation of
multicast frames. [mDNS] only requires compliance with [RFC5198]
rather than IDNA2008 [RFC5895].
This means [mDNS] does not ensure
instances are visually unique and may contain spaces and punctuation
not permitted by IDNA2008.
As such, this might allow users into
becoming misled about the scope of a name.
Replacing ASCII punctuation and spaces in the label with the '_'
character, except when located as the leftmost character, may reduce
some handling issues related to end of string parsing, since labels
in [DNS] normally do not contain spaces or punctuation.
Nevertheless, [DNS] is able to handle such labels within sub-domains
of registered domains.
Services outside the ".local." domain may have applications obtaining
domain search lists provided by DHCP ([RFC2131] and [RFC3315] for
IPv4 and IPv6 respectively or RA DNSSL [RFC6106] also for IPv6.
Internet domains need to be published in [DNS] as A-Labels [RFC3492]
because IDNA2008 compliance depends on A-label enforcement by
registrars.
Therefore A-Labels and not U-Labels must be published in
DNS for Internet domains at this time.
The SRV scheme used by [mDNS] has also been widely adopted in the
Windows OS since it offered a functional replacement for Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) as their initial attempt which lacked
sufficient name hierarchy.
Such common use may represent security
considerations whenever these records can be automatically published.

It is unknown whether sufficient filtering of [mDNS] to expose just
those services likely needed will sufficiently protect wireless
networks.
The extent of using IGMP or MLD for selective forwarding
to mitigate otherwise spurious traffic is unknown.
ULA or [RFC1918] addresses allow safer automatic publication in DNS
since these addresses are unlikely to be routed beyond the site.
These addresses also provide a simple scheme to ascertain which
addresses should be blocked at a network boundary.
The use of other
addresses MUST require specific administrative confirmations.
It
should be noted in the Addendum example, the Brother printer
published a globally routable address.
3.2.
Scope of Discovery
As [mDNS] is currently restricted to a single link, the scope of the
advertisement is limited, by design, to the shared link between
client and the device offering a service.
In a multi-link scenario,
the owner of the advertised service may not have a clear indication
of the scope of its advertisement.
If the advertisement propagates to a larger set of links than
expected, this may result in unauthorized clients (from the
perspective of the owner) connecting to the advertised service.
It
also discloses information (about the host and service) to a larger
set of potential attackers.
If the scope of the discovery is not properly setup or constrained,
then information leaks will happen beyond the appropriate network
which may also expose the network to various forms of attack as well.
3.3.
Multiple Namespaces
There is a possibility of conflicts between local, multi-realm, and
global [DNS] namespaces.
Without adequate feedback, a client may not
know whether the target service is the correct one, which can
therefore enable potential attacks.
A Host unable to recognize when it is in conflict with itself over
multiple realms also represents a potential network stability threat.
3.4.
Authorization
[DNSSEC] can assert the validity but not the veracity of records in a
zone file.
The trust model of the global [DNS] relies on the fact
that human administrators either a) manually enter resource records
into a zone file, or b) configure the [DNS] server to authenticate a
trusted device (e.g., a DHCP server) that can automatically maintain
Otis

Internet-Draft
mDNS xlinks
May 2015
such records.
An imposter may register on the local link and appear as a legitimate
service.
Such "rogue" services may then be automatically registered
in wide area [DNS-SD].
3.5.
Authentication
Up to now, the "plug-and-play" nature of [mDNS] devices have relied
only on physical connectivity to the local network.
If a device is
visible via [mDNS], it had been assumed to be trusted.
When multiple
networks are involved, verifying a host is local using [mDNS] is no
longer possible so other verification schemes must be used.
3.6.
Privacy Considerations
Mobile devices such as smart phones that can expose the location of
their owners by registering services in arbitrary zones pose a risk
to privacy.
Such devices must not register their services in
arbitrary zones without the approval of their operators.
However, it
should be possible to configure one or more "safe" zones, e.g., based
on subnet prefix, in which mobile devices may automatically register
their services.
As noted in [CERTvu550620] private security information is leaked in
many cases.
This includes hostnames and MACs, networking details,
service related details such as those for Printers and NAS devices.
Many consumer printers can not authenticated users or block addresses
when connected with IPv6.
Once this information is leaked,
malefactors are given unlimited access.

Splitting files into parts for upload

Upload files via Customer Portal
You can now upload files up to 250GB in size directly to the Customer Portal. There is no longer any need to use a separate mechanism for uploading large files. Refer to Attaching files via Portal UI for attaching files via the Red Hat Customer Portal.
There is a known issue with the IE browser timing out with uploads that take longer than 15 minutes. This should only happen with extremely large uploads. If you need to provide very large files, please use Chrome/Firefox or FTP until a fix is available.
Red Hat Support Tool
Note: currently there is a size restriction of 1GB for each single file uploaded.
That size restriction is being addressed via RHBZ Bug 1653573.
To Case: To upload files directly from your system, you can also use Red Hat Support Tool (redhat-support-tool). It gives you flexibility and also scripting capabilities. The simplest way to upload files, e.g.: sosreport, is this:
$ redhat-support-tool addattachment -c CASE_NUMBER /path/to/sosreport
Note: See Red Hat Access: Red Hat Support Tool for more complete information on redhat-support-tool, including installation instructions.
To Dropbox FTP:
This will upload your file directly to the Customer Portal. If you want to upload to the FTP site, use the "-f" option:
$ redhat-support-tool addattachment -c CASE_NUMBER -f /path/to/sosreport
Split Files and upload to FTP: If you have a very big vmcore file and you don't have access to the Dropbox FTP site, you can split your file with the "-s" option of newer versions of the support tool to upload the file to the Customer Portal:
$ redhat-support-tool addattachment -c CASE_NUMBER -s 1024 -f /path/to/vmcore
The facility has also been tested using the multi-platform GUI FTP client from http://filezilla-project.org/.
Splitting files into parts for upload
While some customers have no problem uploading 50GB vmcore files to Red Hat, others have problems with anything over 1-2GB in size. Sometimes large uploads do not complete reliably either due to file size or network congestion or other issues resulting in failure to complete the upload successfully.
Failed uploads often must be resumed from the beginning of the file.
If you have had trouble uploading a file in the past to either the portal or via redhat-support-tool (or FTP) due to size, network stability, or other issues, then the file can be split into parts and each smaller part uploaded. The current recommendation when splitting a large file, such as a vmcore, into parts is to break the file into 1GB chunks as a starting point.
If that still fails, fallback to 512m size and try again.
The splitcommand can be used to break a large file into smaller chunks for upload to dropbox.redhat.com or to the support case within the Red Hat Customer Portal.
If a single chunk upload fails, only the upload of that chunk needs to be retried.
For example, the following splits a large 8.5GiB vmcore file into 9 smaller files for upload.
The -b 1024m command line option limits the split file size to a maximum of 1024MB (1GiB) each.
# ls -ltrh largefile.tar.xz
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root
root
8.5G Feb 20 13:54 largefile.tar.xz
# split -b 1024m -a 2 -d largefile.tar.xz largefile.tar.xz.part
# ls -ltrh largefile.tar.xz.*
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 1.0G Feb 21 10:01 largefile.tar.xz.part00
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 1.0G Feb 21 10:01 largefile.tar.xz.part01
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 1.0G Feb 21 10:01 largefile.tar.xz.part02
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 1.0G Feb 21 10:01 largefile.tar.xz.part03
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 1.0G Feb 21 10:01 largefile.tar.xz.part04
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 1.0G Feb 21 10:01 largefile.tar.xz.part05
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 1.0G Feb 21 10:01 largefile.tar.xz.part06
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 1.0G Feb 21 10:02 largefile.tar.xz.part07
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 508M Feb 21 10:02 largefile.tar.xz.part08
The parts can be reassembled using cat command.
# ls -1c -v largefile.tar.xz.part* | xargs -I {} cat {} >> largefile.tar.xz
See man split for further information and command options.
Secure FTP
In addition to the process described above, dropbox.redhat.com now supports uploading files using encrypted data connections through the use of the FTP-ES (explicit mode; "require explicit FTP over TLS") protocol.
Additionally, dropbox-ssl.redhat.com can be accessed via secure FTP (FTP over SSL, explicit). It has the external IP hardcoded into the FTP software configuration. This configuration is required by strictly RFC compliant FTP client/proxies.
The certificate of the ftps service on dropbox.redhat.com is signed by "C=US,O=DigiCert Inc,OU=www.digicert.com,CN=DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA".
For example, "testfile" can be uploaded using FTP-ES using the "lftp" console FTP client in the following fashion (backslash separated for clarity):
# lftp -v -c 'open -e "set ftps:initial-prot "'; \
set ftp:ssl-force true; \
set ftp:ssl-protect-data true; \
set ssl:verify-certificate true; \
open anonymous:ftp@dropbox.redhat.com ; \
cd incoming ; \
put testfile'
Note:
If using a proxy server with Secure FTP it may be necessary to add the line set ftp:proxy
http://HOST:PORT to the command above using your proxy parameters.
# lftp -v -c 'open -e "set ftps:initial-prot ""; \
set ftp:ssl-force true; \
set ftp:ssl-protect-data true; \
set ssl:verify-certificate true; \
set ftp:proxy http://HOST:PORT ; \
open anonymous:ftp@dropbox.redhat.com ; \
cd incoming ; \
put testfile'
FTP
Red Hat has a publicly available anonymous FTP site where anyone can upload files that may not be uploaded correctly to the Red Hat Customer Portal.
These files can be uploaded to the anonymous FTP site dropbox.redhat.com, and placed in the /incoming directory. When logging in to the FTP server, please provide the username "anonymous" and use your email address as the password.
If uploading a vmcore file that is very large and has not had all non-critical pages filtered out (that is kdump did not use makedumpfile -d 31) then use this command to filter out the pages and then continue to upload the output file for analysis.
# makedumpfile -c -d 31 <vmcore> <output file>
Prior to uploading the file, please compress the file using gzip or zip and uniquely name the resulting archive file. The recommended name prefix should be your case number followed by a date or time string or other uniquely identifying information. For example:
$ tar czfS /tmp/001234-$(date +%s)-vmcore.tar.gz myvmcore
$ tar czfS /tmp/001234-$(date +%s)-logs.tar.gz mylogdir/
If the file is very large, you can split it in parts (without causing problem to its content) and then upload it. See Splitting files into parts for upload below.
When the file is successfully uploaded, please provide the support engineer with the exact file name and MD5 or SHA1 message digest of the uploaded files.
Note:
Files uploaded via this method are uploaded insecurely
No files can be downloaded from this FTP site
The files listed under the /incoming directory on this site can not be seen nor can a new directory be created
You will not be able to overwrite an existing file so ensure a unique name is used
You will not be able to resume an upload as this requires the ability to write to an existing file
Ensure all files are transferred in binary format (not text or ASCII mode)
Ensure you are using passive FTP mode
If your firewall does not allow passive FTP mode you may connect to origin-dropbox.redhat.com using active mode.
Here's a quick walk through.
First open the FTP connection
$ ftp dropbox.redhat.com
Connected to dropbox.redhat.com (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX).

Password: user@domain
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.

If it says "Using text mode to transfer files", then you need to change the transfer mode to binary by typing "bin"

Welcome to Red Hat Global Support Services FTP!
|
|
|
|
Please note: the "ls" command is disabled by design.
|
|
You will receive this error if you attempt to run "ls":
|
|
|
|
ls: 550 Permission denied.
|
|
|
|
If you are uploading a file for Technical Support, you
|
|
must include your support ticket number in the filename
|
|
and inform your technician of the upload. Files with names
|
|
that do not follow this convention, such as vmcore or
|
|
vmcore.gz will be deleted.
|
|
|
|
To upload a core successfully, please do the following:
|
|
|
|
ftp> cd incoming
|
|
ftp> put [casenumber]-[file]
|
|
|
|
- Passive transfers are supported, if you require active
|
|
transfers please connect to origin-dropbox.redhat.com
|
|
- Upload resume is supported.
|
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
250 Directory successfully changed.
ftp>
You will notice that you cannot do an "ls" to list the files in /incoming nor can you create a new directory. This is intentional.
You can start uploading the files by using the "put" command. Most users should enable passive mode. For example, if you are using ftp command in Linux, run "passive" to toggle the Passive mode to "on":
ftp> passive
Passive mode off.
ftp> passive
Passive mode on.
ftp>
For Windows ftp command, run "literal pasv" to change to passive mode:
ftp> literal pasv
227 Entering Passive Mode (XXX,XXX,XXX,XXX,XXX,XX)
ftp>
Then proceed to upload the file using one of the commands below. Replace [filename] with the name of the file you want to upload. If the file is not in current directory then you should specify the destination as shown below:
ftp> put [filename]
ftp> put /some/path/[filename] /incoming/[filename]
And type "bye", or "quit", when you have finished uploading the files
ftp> bye
221 Goodbye.
To compute the MD5 message digest of the files you uploaded,
run
$ md5sum [filename]
Or, alternatively, to compute the SHA1 message digest of the files you uploaded,
run
$ sha1sum [filename]
Alternate mode using curl with proxy server
You can also upload files directly from your server with a simple command using your local proxy:
# curl -T vmcore-case-no-99999999 -x http://yourproxy.example.com:8080 ftp://dropbox.redhat.com/incoming/

Is there a way to use WinSCP? When I set it up, it lets me in Okay, but you are in the root, not incoming. I can't seem to change to the incoming directory, and I can't figure out a way to specify going to "incoming" directly.

A Permissioned Denied error on login is normal, both in / or in /incoming. As stated it is a "blind" anonymous ftp server, which means you have no rights to list the content in the directories. However uploading files in /incoming should work fine.

Jagadish, if you're having difficulty uploading files to the FTP server, you should mention this in your support case emails.

Since downloading files from dropbox.redhat.com is forbidden, how can get the file, that someone uploaded there when I know the filename?
Thanks

Various customers (banking, telco, ...) do not allow uploading via FTP or SFTP. Servers (and infrastructure) simply don't have Internet access and desktops are behind proxies that block most protocols other than HTTP(S).
So uploading to the customer portal is the only viable alternative in this case. Fortunately, despite what is claimed, one can upload files larger than 1GB. We have send vmcore files up to almost 2GB via the customer portal without a problem. But it is likely slower than FTP or SFTP.

Sadly, no longer the case. Since the latest update of the portal, a hard limit of 250Mb is set on uploads. Anything more than that and the "Upload" button is greyed out.

I just verified the full cycle of storing a file with the command stated above in the document, upload and verification of the uploaded content: works as expected here.
I suspect you have interfering networkequipment in the way. For an indepth analysis (running the client with debug options, sniffing packets etc.) you could open a case with the Red Hat support.

You should also use a better filename, i.e. include your credentials and a case number.

We are using curl to automate the upload, but we still have to manually update the case notes to indicate what files were dropped in the dropbox.
Is there a way to automate updating the case notes with the file names to eliminate that manual step?

The curl method posted at the bottom is very, very helpful to those of us operating behind a BlueCoat proxy (those don't seem to handle FTP all that well).
Huge thanks for the KB update!

In a rescue mode can we follow this procedure once sosreport is generated from /tm/sosreport-XYZ, to send the report to RHT support?

The Metasploitable virtual machine is an intentionally vulnerable version of Ubuntu Linux designed for testing security tools and demonstrating common vulnerabilities. Version 2 of this virtual machine is available for download and ships with even more vulnerabilities than the original image. This virtual machine is compatible with VMWare, VirtualBox, and other common virtualization platforms. By default, Metasploitable's network interfaces are bound to the NAT and Host-only network adapters, and the image should never be exposed to a hostile network. (Note: A video tutorial on installing Metasploitable 2 is available here.)
This document outlines many of the security flaws in the Metasploitable 2 image. Currently missing is documentation on the web server and web application flaws as well as vulnerabilities that allow a local user to escalate to root privileges. This document will continue to expand over time as many of the less obvious flaws with this platform are detailed.
Getting Started
After the virtual machine boots, login to console with username msfadmin and password msfadmin. From the shell, run the ifconfig command to identify the IP address.
msfadmin@metasploitable:~$ ifconfig

Services
From our attack system (Linux, preferably something like Kali Linux), we will identify the open network services on this virtual machine using the Nmap Security Scanner. The following command line will scan all TCP ports on the Metasploitable 2 instance:

Nearly every one of these listening services provides a remote entry point into the system. In the next section, we will walk through some of these vectors.
Unix Basics
TCP ports 512, 513, and 514 are known as "r" services, and have been misconfigured to allow remote access from any host (a standard ".rhosts + +" situation). To take advantage of this, make sure the "rsh-client" client is installed (on Ubuntu), and run the following command as your local root user. If you are prompted for an SSH key, this means the rsh-client tools have not been installed and Ubuntu is defaulting to using SSH.

This is about as easy as it gets. The next service we should look at is the Network File System (NFS). NFS can be identified by probing port 2049 directly or asking the portmapper for a list of services. The example below using rpcinfo to identify NFS and showmount -e to determine that the "/" share (the root of the file system) is being exported. You will need the rpcbind and nfs-common Ubuntu packages to follow along.

Getting access to a system with a writeable filesystem like this is trivial. To do so (and because SSH is running), we will generate a new SSH key on our attacking system, mount the NFS export, and add our key to the root user account's authorized_keys file:
root@ubuntu:~# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

Backdoors
On port 21, Metasploitable2 runs vsftpd, a popular FTP server. This particular version contains a backdoor that was slipped into the source code by an unknown intruder. The backdoor was quickly identified and removed, but not before quite a few people downloaded it. If a username is sent that ends in the sequence :) [ a happy face ], the backdoored version will open a listening shell on port 6200. We can demonstrate this with telnet or use the Metasploit Framework module to automatically exploit it:
root@ubuntu:~# telnet 192.168.99.131 21
Trying 192.168.99.131...
Connected to 192.168.99.131.

Escape character is '^]'.
id;
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
On port 6667, Metasploitable2 runs the UnreaIRCD IRC daemon. This version contains a backdoor that went unnoticed for months - triggered by sending the letters "AB" following by a system command to the server on any listening port. Metasploit has a module to exploit this in order to gain an interactive shell, as shown below.

Much less subtle is the old standby "ingreslock" backdoor that is listening on port 1524. The ingreslock port was a popular choice a decade ago for adding a backdoor to a compromised server. Accessing it is easy:
root@ubuntu:~# telnet 192.168.99.131 1524
Trying 192.168.99.131...

Unintentional Backdoors
In addition to the malicious backdoors in the previous section, some services are almost backdoors by their very nature. The first of which installed on Metasploitable2 is distccd. This program makes it easy to scale large compiler jobs across a farm of like-configured systems. The problem with this service is that an attacker can easily abuse it to run a command of their choice, as demonstrated by the Metasploit module usage below.
msfconsole

id
uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)
Samba, when configured with a writeable file share and "wide links" enabled (default is on), can also be used as a backdoor of sorts to access files that were not meant to be shared. The example below uses a Metasploit module to provide access to the root filesystem using an anonymous connection and a writeable share.

Weak Passwords
In additional to the more blatant backdoors and misconfigurations, Metasploitable 2 has terrible password security for both system and database server accounts. The primary administrative user msfadmin has a password matching the username. By discovering the list of users on this system, either by using another flaw to capture the passwd file, or by enumerating these user IDs via Samba, a brute force attack can be used to quickly access multiple user accounts. At a minimum, the following weak system accounts are configured on the system.
Account Name
Password
msfadmin
msfadmin
user
user
postgres
postgres
sys
batman
klog
123456789
service
service
In addition to these system-level accounts, the PostgreSQL service can be accessed with username postgres and password postgres, while the MySQL service is open to username root with an empty password. The VNC service provides remote desktop access using the password password.
Vulnerable Web Services
Metasploitable 2 has deliberately vulnerable web applications pre-installed. The web server starts automatically when Metasploitable 2 is booted. To access the web applications, open a web browser and enter the URL http://<IP> where <IP> is the IP address of Metasploitable 2. One way to accomplish this is to install Metasploitable 2 as a guest operating system in Virtual Box and change the network interface settings from "NAT" to "Host Only". (Note: A video tutorial on installing Metasploitable 2 is available here.)
In this example, Metasploitable 2 is running at IP 192.168.56.101. Browsing to http://192.168.56.101/ shows the web application home page.
192.168.56/24 is the default "host only" network in Virtual Box. IP address are assigned starting from "101". Depending on the order in which guest operating systems are started, the IP address of Metasploitable 2 will vary.
To access a particular web application, click on one of the links provided. Individual web applications may additionally be accessed by appending the application directory name onto http://<IP> to create URL http://<IP>/<Application Folder>/. For example, the Mutillidae application may be accessed (in this example) at address http://192.168.56.101/mutillidae/. The applications are installed in Metasploitable 2 in the /var/www directory. (Note: See a list with command ls /var/www.) In the current version as of this writing, the applications are
mutillidae (NOWASP Mutillidae 2.1.19)dvwa (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)phpMyAdmintikiwiki (TWiki)tikiwiki-olddav (WebDav)
Mutillidae
The Mutillidae web application (NOWASP (Mutillidae)) contains all of the vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top Ten plus a number of other vulnerabilities such as HTML-5 web storage, forms caching, and click-jacking. Inspired by DVWA, Mutillidae allows the user to change the "Security Level" from 0 (completely insecure) to 5 (secure). Additionally three levels of hints are provided ranging from "Level 0 - I try harder" (no hints) to "Level 2 - noob" (Maximum hints). If the application is damaged by user injections and hacks, clicking the "Reset DB" button resets the application to its original state.
Tutorials on using Mutillidae are available at the webpwnized YouTube Channel.
Enable hints in the application by click the "Toggle Hints" button on the menu bar:
The Mutillidae application contains at least the following vulnerabilities on these respective pages:

DVWA
From the DVWA home page: "Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.".
DVWA contains instructions on the home page and additional information is available at Wiki Pages - Damn Vulnerable Web App.
Default username - admin
Default password - password
Information Disclosure
Additionally, an ill-advised PHP information disclosure page can be found at http://<IP>/phpinfo.php. In this example, the URL would be http://192.168.56.101/phpinfo.php. The PHP info information disclosure vulnerability provides internal system information and service version information that can be used to look up vulnerabilities. For example, noting that the version of PHP disclosed in the screenshot is version 5.2.4, it may be possible that the system is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1823 and CVE-2012-2311 which affected PHP before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2.

Scalable DNS-SD (SSD) Threats
draft-otis-dnssd-scalable-dns-sd-threats-03
Abstract
mDNS combined with Service Discovery (DNS-SD) extends network
resource distribution beyond the reach of multicast normally limited
by the MAC Bridge.
Since related resources are often not
authenticated, either local resources are inherently trustworthy or
are subsequently verified by associated services.
Resource
distribution becomes complex when a hybrid scheme combines adjacent
network resources into a common unicast DNS-SD structure.
This
document explores related security considerations.

Introduction
As described by [IEEE.802-1D.2004], MAC entities normally make
services known via multicast announcements that do not extend beyond
the Bridge as a basis for networking and layer 3 protocols.
mDNS
[RFC6762] allows non-centralized resource collection that can be
structured as defined in DNS-SD [RFC6763].
This structure, when used
in conjunction with DNS [RFC1035], provides an alternative to
multicast announcement to deal with wireless links that are orders of
magnitude less reliable than their wired counterparts.
To improve
transmission reliability, [IEEE.802-11.2012] requires positive
acknowledgement of unicast frames but does not support positive
acknowledgement of multicast frames.
In [IEEE.802-11.2012] wireless
networks, multicast frames are transmitted at a lower data rate
supported by all receivers.
Multicast on wireless networks may
thereby lower overall network throughput.
Some network
administrators block some multicast traffic or convert it to a series
of link-layer unicast frames.
Other types of wireless networks may
impose more demanding limitations as described by [RFC4944].
As a
result, it is common to observe much higher loss of multicast frames
on wireless compared against wired network technologies.
A namespace structured from adjacent networks using proxy-ed mDNS
resources lacks a means to quickly resolve unicast name collision.
Although an expensive promiscuous mode of unicast operation at
multicast destinations might replicate mDNS features within a unicast
environment, not well covered in [RFC4903] are issues related to
wireless upstream clients unable to operate in promiscuous mode,
indeterminate latency, and PPP links requiring a NAT or IPv4 ARP
proxy.
As such, a non-hybrid multicast/unicast scheme would be
problematic.
Scalable DNS-SD (SSD) proposes to automatically gather autonomously
named mDNS [RFC6762] resources of adjacent networks within separate
namespace zones or realms as defined by [RFC7368].
Realms are often
contained in separate subdomains that correspond with a link-local
namespace.
Making routable resources visible and accessible from
other networks via unicast DNS [RFC1035] structured per DNS-SD
[RFC6763] mitigates the level of multicast mDNS traffic in larger
networks.
Reliance on DNS [RFC1035] might leverage multi-network
configurations that use mDNS [RFC6762] that proxy mDNS resources into
DNS-SD using [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid].

Terminology and Abbreviations
o Border: A point, typically resident on a router, between two
networks at which filtering and forwarding policies for different
types of traffic may be applied.
o ISP: Internet Service Provider.
An entity that provides access
to the Internet.
In this document, a service provider
specifically offers Internet access using IPv6 and may also offer
IPv4 Internet access.
The service provider can provide such
access over a variety of different transport methods such as DSL,
cable, wireless, and others.
o Realm: A network delimited by a defined border. i.e. a guest
network within a homenet may form a realm.
o ULA: IPv6 Unique Local Address [RFC4193].
o Global Namespace: A globally unique name resolved within global
DNS namespace bootstrapped from a root zone.
o Realm Namespace: A realm specific namespace that may not be
resolved within the global DNS namespace, perhaps due to Special
Use domain designations.
o Local Namespace: A namespace accessible for link-local
resolution that may be referenced from an Ambiguous Local
Qualified Domain Name (ALQDN) representing a network segment or
broadcast domain.

Scalable DNS-SD (SSD) Realm and Global Namespace
2.1.
Realm and Global Names
Conflicts between a local realm and global DNS [RFC1035] namespaces
may occur.
Without adequate feedback and latency constraints, a
client may be unable to determine desired service targets.
Target
assessment may impair network stability when a cache policy renames
resources propagated into different realms.
Determining actual
conflicts might depend on inherent identifiers such as MAC addresses
or device specific GUIDs, otherwise conflict resolution may become
increasingly byzantine.

2.1.1.
SSD Structures
SSD locates SRV and TXT RRsets resources in the forms:
_<sn>._<Proto>.<SrvDOM>.<ParentDOM>.
<Instance>._<sn>._<Proto>.<SrvDOM>.<ParentDOM>.
<sub>._sub._<sn>._<Proto>.<SrvDOM>.<ParentDOM>.
For DNS-SD, Proto="_udp" represents all non-TCP transports otherwise
it is "_tcp".
_<sn> = IANA Registered Service Name
To facilitate browsing, DNS-SD also supports a DNS meta-query of PTR
RRsets at "_services._dns-sd._udp.<Domain>" which yields service
names which may vary by host along with a domain name.
Only the
first two labels in the PTR rdata are relevant in the construction of
subsequent Service Instance Enumeration PTR queries to further
discover specific service types.
[I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid] conveyance extends '.local.'
TLD namespace
into '.home.' or an Ambiguous Local Qualified Domain Name (ALQDN)
space, such as '.sitelocal.' as described in Section 3.7.4 of
[RFC7368] where DNS [RFC1035] can be facilitated using split horizon
methods described by [RFC6950] or similar schemes described by
[RFC6281].
It seems there is some controversy regarding the
designation of .home as a special use domain defined by
[I-D.cheshire-homenet-dot-home] which does not follow conventions
defined by [I-D.ietf-dnsop-alt-tld].
Either scheme avoids security
issues related with global DNS publishing DNS-SD, even when
configured in a split-horizon mode of operation.
Unfortunately, the
latter can not ensure the single de-facto .home label is formally
excluded from the global DNS when designating a namespace that does
not use multicast DNS.
Any scheme supporting a sitelocal namespace
must ensure queries are not forwarded to the Internet or to global
DNS servers.
[I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid] suggests a split of traditional namespace
that is restricted to letters, digits and hyphens and resolves only
address resources, from the rich text namespace resolving PTR, SRV
and TXT that facilitate service browsing.
These resources are
further bifurcated into separate link related namespace resources.

2.1.2.
Scope of Discovery
As mDNS [RFC6762] is currently restricted to a single link, the scope
of the advertisement is limited, by design, to the shared link
between client and the device offering a service.
When scaling for
multi-links, the owner of the advertised service may propagate to a
larger set of links or a larger realm than expected, which may result
in unauthorized clients (from the perspective of the owner)
connecting to the advertised service.
It also discloses information
(about the host and service) to a larger set of potential attackers.
If the scope of the discovery is not properly constrained, then
information leaks may happen beyond the appropriate network and
expose the network to various forms of attack.
As such, services
normally limited to local link should be assigned a separate
subdomain normally not accessible from the Internet.
To reduce the amount of multicast traffic, widely distributing mDNS
resources using unicast DNS-SD may scale better, but exposure of mDNS
[RFC6762] derived resources to the Internet along with possibly
sensitive details has proven problematic as noted by [CERTvu550620].
Protocol vulnerabilities can be found in reports published by a large
number of vendors, Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT), and
Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT).
With this
diversity of sources, specific concerns may not be captured by
Request for Comments (RFC) publications of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF).
Services might be sought outside the ".local." domain when
applications obtain domain search lists provided by DHCP ([RFC2131]
and [RFC3315] for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively or RA DNSSL [RFC6106]
also for IPv6.
Unfortunately, DHCPv6 does not support ULA assignment
which instead requires some sort of NAT found with VPNs.
Domains
also need to be published in DNS [RFC1035] as A-Labels [RFC3492]
because IDNA2008 compliance depends on A-label enforcement by
registrars.
The SRV scheme used by mDNS [RFC6762] has also been widely adopted in
the Windows OS since it offered a functional replacement for Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) as their initial attempt lacked
sufficient name hierarchy.
Such common use may represent security
considerations whenever these records might become automatically
published.
2.1.2.1.
Visual Spoofing
Visual selection of autonomously named resources becomes especially
salient when names are not ensured to be uniquely represented.
mDNS

dnssd Scalable DNS-SD Threats

[RFC6762] only requires compliance with [RFC5198] rather than
IDNA2008 [RFC5895].
This less restrictive use of namespace may
impair the defense of critical services from look-alike attack.
mDNS
[RFC6762] does not ensure instances are visually unique and allows
spaces and punctuation not permitted by IDNA2008.
To better ensure local namespace can be recognized, alternative zones
might replace ASCII punctuation and spaces in SrvDOM labels with the
'_' character except when located as the leftmost character.
Such a
convention should reduce visual confusion and handling issues related
to end of string parsing, since labels in DNS [RFC1035] normally do
not contain spaces or punctuation.
Nevertheless, DNS [RFC1035] is
able to handle such labels within sub-domains of registered domains.
2.1.3.
Restricted Distribution of Sitelocal Addresses
ULA or [RFC1918] addresses allow safer automatic publication in DNS
since these addresses are unlikely to be routed beyond the site.
These addresses also provide a simple scheme to ascertain which
addresses should be blocked at a network boundary.
The use of other
addresses MUST require specific administrative confirmations.
It
should be noted in the Addendum example, the Brother printer
published a Globally routable address.
When doing so, address translation or overlays using Unique Local
Addresses, ULAs [RFC4193] can offer a significant level of protection
since typical link-local addresses are not usable from other
networks.
Although ULAs are to be treated as being globally
routable, both ULA or [RFC1918] addresses typically indicate site
local.
Section 3.2 of [RFC4193] are locally defined and handled as
Global addresses although not intended to be routed beyond the site
or to those not having explicit routing provisions.
Section 4.1 of [RFC4193] indicates the default behavior of exterior
routing protocol sessions between administrative routing regions must
be to ignore receipt of and not advertise prefixes in the FC00::/7
block.
A network operator may specifically configure prefixes longer
than FC00::/7 for inter-site communication.
Specifically, these
prefixes are not designed to aggregate.
Routers by default do not
block ULA prefixes which makes it important to confirm how ULA
traffic is handled by the access provider.
ULA or [RFC1918] addresses are not normally routed over the Internet
where their use provides a degree of isolation.
For either home or
enterprise networks, ULAs as an overlay network avoids dynamic
network address translation tables and permits local routing that is
isolated from direct Internet access.
ULAs also permit local
communications to remain unaffected by Internet related link failures

or scope limitations imposed by use of multicast protocols.
ULAs avoid a need to renumber internal-only private nodes when
changing ISPs, or when ISPs restructure their address allocations.
In these situations, use of ULA offers an effective tool for
protecting internal-only nodes.
As such, more than just the security
considerations discussed in mDNS [RFC6762] and DNS-SD [RFC6763] are
needed.
For example, DNS-SD [RFC6763] states the following: "Since
DNS-SD is just a specification for how to name and use records in the
existing DNS, it has no specific additional security requirements
over and above those that already apply to DNS queries and DNS
updates."
This simply overlooks that many devices are not
automatically published in DNS nor can it be assumed they are able to
handle the access that DNS might permit.
Current BTMM [RFC6281] only publishes ULAs of hosts in DNS able to
authenticate when setting up an overlay network.
Remaining devices,
such as printers, are accessed as services offered by authenticating
hosts.
DNS resources should never be considered to offer privacy
even in split-horizon configurations.
DNS is unable to authenticate
incoming queries nor can it offer application layer protection.
Since many prefixes are expected to be in use within environments
served by [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid], errors related to network boundary
detections becomes critical.
As such, DNS SHOULD NOT publish
addresses of devices unable to authenticate sessions traversing the
Internet.
2.1.4.
Avoid publishing DNS-SD resources in global DNS for home
networks.
Even when DNSSEC uses NSEC or NSEC3, DNS-SD nevertheless exposes all
listed services.
Since most home systems use devices having limited
resources and lack many security mechanisms normally used to ensure
secure operation, these services should remain obscured from the
Internet.
Access to DNS-SD resources should be predicated on access
granted using secure methods such as via VPN or IPSec exchanges.
2.1.5.
Confirming Valid Resources
[RFC6950] Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) for DHCP as
specified by [RFC7513] may help administrators qualify resources
published in DNS.
DNS-SD [RFC6763] recommends additional DNS records
such as associated PTR and TXT SHOULD be generated to improve network
efficiency for both unicast and multicast DNS-SD responses.
This
behavior further increases some risks related to query/response
ratios and the likelihood of exposure of security sensitive
information.

This new routable namespace also lacks the benefit of registrar
involvement and may not afford an administrator an ability to
mitigate nefarious activity, such as spoofing and phishing, without
requisite controls having been first carefully established.
When a
device has access to different realms on multiple interfaces, it is
not even clear how simple conflict resolution avoids threatening
network stability while resolving names conveyed over disparate
technologies.
2.1.6.
Selective Forwarding based on IGMP or MLD snooping
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376] supports
multicast on IPv4 networks.
Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)
[RFC3810] supports multicast management on IPv6 networks using ICMPv6
messaging in contrast to IGMP's bare IP encapsulation.
This
management allows routers to announce their multicast membership to
neighboring routers.
To optimize which LANs receive forwarded
multicast frames, IGMP or MLD snooping can be used to determine the
presence of listeners as a means to permit selective forwarding of
multicast frames as well.
2.1.7.
VLAN
Use of VLAN such as [RFC5517] can selectively extend multicast
forwarding beyond Bridge limitations.
While not a general solution,
use of VLAN can both isolate and unite specific networks.
2.1.8.
DHCP
IP address assignment and host registration might use a single or
forwarded DHCP [RFC2131] or [RFC3315] server for IPv4 and IPv6
respectively that responds to interconnected networks as a means to
register hosts and addresses.
DHCP does not ensure against name or
address conflict nor is it intended to configure routers.
2.2.
Exfiltration and Poisoning
IP addresses made visible by DNSSEC [RFC4033] or DNS [RFC1035] that
conform with DNS-SD [RFC6763] might be used, but the automated
population of information into DNS [RFC1035] should be limited to
administrative systems.
Automated conversion of mDNS [RFC6762] into unicast DNS [RFC1035] can
be problematic from a security standpoint as can widespread
propagation of multicast frames. mDNS [RFC6762] only requires
compliance with [RFC5198] rather than IDNA2008 [RFC5895].
This means
mDNS [RFC6762] will not ensure instances are visually unique and may
contain spaces and punctuation not permitted by IDNA2008.
As such,

this might cause users into becoming misled about the associated
service.
SSD MUST include requisite filtering necessary to prevent data ex-
filtration or the interception of sensitive services.
Any exchanged
data must first ensure locality, limit the resources gathered,
resolved, and propagated to just those elements that can be
effectively administrated.
It is critical to ensure normal network
protection is not lost for hosts that depend on link-local addressing
and exclusion of routable traffic.
A printer would be one such
example of a host that can not be upgraded.
2.3.
Amplification Concerns
It is unknown whether sufficient filtering of mDNS [RFC6762] to
expose just those services likely needed will provide sufficient
network protection.
The extent of using IGMP or MLD for selective
forwarding to mitigate otherwise spurious traffic is unknown.
Instance names and <SrvDOM> intended to correspond with link-local
domains may use Unicode for Network Interchange [RFC5198] encoding
but excludes ASCII control characters while also allowing escaped
periods "\." and other punctuation and spaces.
For DNS-SD, Proto="_udp" represents all non-TCP transports otherwise
it is "_tcp".
_<sn> = IANA Registered Service Name
Optional service browsing and various RRsets could result in large
responses limited only by an MTU that may become fairly large in
various HomeNet networking protocols.
Increased reliance on Resource Record Sets (RRsets) for discovery
increases DDoS amplification concerns when overall RRset size is
overlooked.
The extent of this amplification had been constrained by
the minimum MTU first established by [RFC0791] and noted by [RFC1191]
of 576 bytes which accommodates 512 byte UDP DNS messages.
Most
Internet links are now able to handle much larger MTUs.
Per
[RFC2460], the minimum 1280 byte MTU is specified for IPv6.
To ensure minimal latency, DNS queries are first made using UDP.
When a response becomes truncated, TCP is then normally attempted.
Reliance on UDP has been relaxed by [RFC5966].
The size of a PTR
RRset can be fairly large and result in UDP amplification issues when
carried within a large minimum MTU.
The potential query/response
ratio may have a large impact on ISPs and in turn impact a large
number of users.

At each of the DNS-SD SRV and TXT Resource Record Sets locations that
offer instance and service enumerations, administration of the
resulting RRsets must ensure these resources are suitable for
distribution and the DNS-SD query to response ratio is suitable for
Internet access.
DNS-SD [RFC6763] should not be viewed as a catalog structure of
desired services suitable for Internet use.
[I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid]
is to be used to bridge adjacent networks but this risks conveying
resources of hosts unable to safely facilitate Internet access.
Since [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid] should opt for the most conservative
address mode when selecting addresses to be distributed, ULAs or
[RFC1918] address should represent a default option rather than
selecting GUAs.
Browsing change notification facilitated with [I-D.ietf-dnssd-push]
uses the message structure defined by [RFC2136] but is based on TCP.
TCP eliminates spoofed source query attacks and congestion issues.
If neither QTYPE nor QCLASS are ANY (255) then this is a specific
subscription to changes for the given name.
When QTYPE or QCLASS are
ANY (255) then this becomes a wildcard subscription to changes of the
given name for any type and/or class, as appropriate.
Browsing resource synchronization should use [I-D.ietf-dnssd-push]
instead of depending on expanded RRsets or UDP transactions.
Directly using DNS when overloaded would be much slower.
This is
because DNS [RFC1035] recommends 5 second timeouts with a doubling on
two subsequent retries for a total of 35 seconds.
2.3.1.
Resource Exhaustion Threats
DNS is currently vulnerable whenever responses are much larger than
associated queries which could occur when browsing a domain offering
services from a large number of hosts.
To mitigate specific
problematic query sources, an experimental mode of DNS operation is
described in a technical note: DNS Response Rate Limiting
[ISC-TN-2012-1-Draft1].
Additional information is available at
[RedBarn].
Another experiment is [I-D.ietf-dnsop-cookies] which reduces reliance
on DNS Response Rate Limiting and minimizes resources needed to
handle random initial exchanges in a manner as described by [RFC6013]
for forged sources of initial TCP <Syn> where servers keep client
state within encrypted cookies.

Protection of SSD related interchange
SSD protocols may require additional steps to ensure against the
poisoning of resource collection where close attention should be
given to the scope of a ULA or [RFC1918] where the related resources
are not to be directly exchanged with the Internet.
3.1.
Link-Local
[RFC3927] provides an overview of IPv4 address complexities related
to dealing with multiple segments and interfaces.
IPv6 introduces
new paradigms in respect to interface address assignments which offer
scoping as explained in [RFC4291].
3.2.
Authorization Issues
DNSSEC [RFC4033] can assert the validity but not the veracity of
records in a zone file.
The trust model of the global DNS [RFC1035]
relies on the fact that human administrators either a) manually enter
resource records into a zone file, or b) configure the DNS [RFC1035]
server to authenticate a trusted device (e.g., a DHCP server) that
can automatically maintain such records.
An imposter may register on the local link and appear as a legitimate
service.
Such "rogue" services may then be automatically registered
in wide area DNS-SD [RFC6763].
3.3.
Authentication Issues
Up to now, the "plug-and-play" nature of mDNS [RFC6762] devices have
relied only on physical connectivity to the local network.
If a
device is visible via mDNS [RFC6762], it had been assumed to be
trusted.
When multiple networks are involved, verifying a host is
local using mDNS [RFC6762] is no longer possible so other
verification schemes will be needed.
3.4.
Privacy Considerations
Mobile devices such as smart phones that can expose the location of
their owners by registering services in arbitrary zones pose a risk
to privacy.
Such devices must not register their services in
arbitrary zones without the approval of their operators.
However, it
should be possible to configure one or more "safe" zones, e.g., based
on subnet prefix, in which mobile devices may automatically register
their services.
As noted in [CERTvu550620] private security information is leaked in
many cases.
This includes hostnames and MACs, networking details,

service related details such as those for Printers and NAS devices.
Many consumer printers can not authenticate users or block addresses
when connected with IPv6.
Once this information is leaked,
malefactors are thereby given unlimited access.

Appendix B.
Uncontrolled Access Example
The risk is that adequate IPv6 filtering is simply not available on
either current printers, scanners, cameras and other devices never
intended to be used directly on the Internet.
For example, in the case of a printer:
ftp [DNS entry]
Trying 2699:9999:7300:1510:3205:5cff:fe23:9958...
Connected to [DNS entry]
220 FTP print service:V-1.13/Use the network password for the ID if
updating.
Name (BRN30066C239958.local.:dlr): ftp
230 User ftp logged in.
ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||62468|)
150 Transfer Start

-r--r--r--

2001 CFG-PAGE.TXT
----------
1 root
printer
0 Sep 28
2001 Toner-Low-------
226 Data Transfer OK.
ftp>
From here, I can print a file with no further authentication.
But the printer also now appears on the Internet with TCP ports
21,23,25,80,515,631 and 9100 active.
I can scan a document that
was left in the flatbed.
I can send a fax.
Or I can print many
copies of black pages if I want to do a physical DOS.
And, thanks
to the globally routable address present, I can reach this from
anywhere in the world.
