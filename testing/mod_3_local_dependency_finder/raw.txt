А что касаемо mikrotik то попробовав раз, ем и сейчас). Помогу приготовить любое блюдо c mikrotik.
Немного из того, что реализовано в последнее время, из беспроводных технологий https://youtu.be/x5BgUY0HqzE и для чего это делается https://youtu.be/6kQRZpS7IGk.
P.S. В данном проекте mikrotik не только маршрутизирует, но и используется весьма неожиданным образом ;).

Users should therefore always make their own investigations as to the accuracy or and completeness of the information before relying on it.
You should be aware that any consultant who has received appropriate training by MikroTik and who has been in practice for at least one year can apply to be included on the list. The fact of their listing does not signify that MikroTik recommends or endorses their work in any way, merely that they have applied to be listed. MikroTik therefore makes no representation or warranty concerning the quality of their work. You should satisfy yourself of the suitability of any particular consultant prior to engagement.
MikroTik shall not be liable for any consequences resulting from the use of any of the information of the list.
Become a consultant
It is simple to become a MikroTik certified consultant. If you have an MTCNA (score 75%+) and at least one valid MikroTik engineer level certificate (MTCRE, MTCWE, MTCTCE, MTCUME, MTCIPv6E, MTCINE or MTCSE) with a score 75%+, apply from within your mikrotik.com account (Edit account details section), state your fields of expertise, and we will add you to the list. The information will be processed within three business days. To stay in the consultant list, you will have to have valid certificates, participate in the MikroTik Forum
and attend the MUM events in your country conducting RouterOS case studies or workshops for the attendees.
