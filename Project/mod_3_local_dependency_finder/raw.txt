I couldn't really find any information on this, so I'm posting here in hope that someone can help me with this.
I plugged an external HDD into my ASUS RT-N66U router. Recognition was no problem but now I'm a little stuck on how to get everything set up.
I wanted to make my HDD accessible from outside my home network, i.e. from the Internet via FTP but I can't seems to find a good documentation on how to do all these. The router manual is not very helpful and I did some trials and errors myself, but can't really get it to work.
I've already setup DDNS e.g. host.asuscomm.com
Enable the DDNS Client = Yes
Enable wildcard = No
I seem to have set up the FTP server correctly because I was able to FTP to the HDD within my LAN but I just can't seem to access the HDD from outside my home network.
I'm using Merlin's latest firmware 3.0.0.3.178.15.
Could someone point me into the right direction, please?
Thanks!

I haven't tested it, but try FTP'ing to port 2021 instead of 21 when outside the house.

I tried setting the port to 2021 but still can't access from the Internet.
Please see screenshot, are the info correct?

Don't add a forward rule.
There's a configuration field already for this taking care of things automatically.

I turned off the port forwarding & remove the rule but still can't connect from the Internet.
Wonder what's causing the problem.
Any clue?

Make sure your modem isn't also acting as a router, creating a double NAT issue, and blocking any packets before they even reach your Asus router.
One way to test it is to enable WAN access to the web interface (on the Firewall page), then see if you can access the router's config page on port 8080.

Ok, I've enabled WAN access to the web interface (on the Firewall page) and was able to access the router's config page on port 8080 via the Internet.
So does that mean I have doube NAT issue or not?
How should I proceed from here. Sorry I'm noob with networking, please bear with me.

If the web interface is accessible, then you don't have any double NAT problem.
Now that I'm back home I actually tested it.
It works for me, however it uses port 21 and not 2021 (not sure what that FTP port field is exactly for, I'll have to dig into the source code to figure it out).
So just enable FTP, then you should be able to FTP using your DDNS hostname, on the default port (21).
No need to forward anything.
Test result from a server outside my home:

Ok, here are 2 different logs.
1 connected internally via LAN, the other via Internet.
When connected via Internet, I encountered timeout after after this statement "Here comes the directory listing."
Any clue?
Thanks

So you do connect, only you have issues listing folder content.
In that case that sounds more a firewall issue on your remote end.
Try switching to PORT mode (instead of Passive), see if that helps.

Thanks Merlin.
The FTP client I'm using does not have Active mode, I selected Port instead, are they referring to the same thing, right?
I supposed there's no solution to my problem?

Yes, PORT is the same thing as "active", tho it's not called active mode.
You have no problem actually connecting to your FTP server, so I don't think it's a matter of configuration, otherwise you wouldn't even be able to log in.
Maybe try a different FTP client (such as Filezilla), otherwise I'm afraid I'm out of ideas, sorry.

Thanks Merlin, appreciate your patience with me.
I tried Filezilla but still no go
Let me give it a last shot.
From my screenshot below, did I input the values correctly?
Should the Local IP be 192.168.1.1 or some other range?

As I mentioned before, do not add a forward rule - forwarding rules are only for when you want to forward a connection beyond your router.
In this case, the connection must terminate on the router.

Workaround - WAN Access to USB Drive
After spending 3 days I finally have a solution to this problem.
First, credit is given to the comment at this website:
http://community.wd.com/t5/My-Book-Live-Duo/Please-enable-port-setting-for-FTP/m-p/556514#M4133
Major steps are given by (Asus Routers):
1. Forward an arbitrary Port Range (1000, for example) to Local Port 21. Local IP must be the assigned router IP (not a local machine). Protocol TCP;
2. Make sure that FTP is enabled at FTP Share (USB application, Servers Center);
3. Update all the changes;
4. Test WAN access to your files by typing ftp://[yourdomain].asuscomm.com:1000,
where 1000 is the selected port at Step 1;
5. If everything is working then you will have FTP over port 1000.
Quick tip: Try WAN on a cellphone with WI-FI turned off.
Hope it helps.

FTP Share/Server for IP Camera Recording (AC3200)

Hi Guys,
I'm trying to figure out if this set up is possible: enable the FTP server on my AC3200 with a USB flash drive so that my IP Cameras (Foscam) can send motion detection images to that FTP for internal use.
I read on this forum that there are some bugs with the way the flash drive is formatted, and I tried formatting as ext4, but it doesn't work (I believe it's because the client doesn't have write-access to the drive, options to change permissions for the drive are grayed out / unavailable).
My camera confirms that it can connect to the FTP successfully, but nothing gets recorded.
If ext4 is Linux based, and I'm assuming my IP camera is Windows based, is there a way to make this work?
On a side note, I am using USB 2.0 slot on my router.
When I plugged into USB 3.0, my 2.4Ghz band stopped working (seems odd!?). Any insight is appreciated!

They will be greyed out if you have enabled "anonymous login" because user accounts are not used in that configuration.

It doesn't matter if you're using ext4, fat32, ntfs, Linux or Windows; FTP is FTP is FTP. Make sure that your camera is changing to the correct directory after in connects otherwise it won't be able to write. See below:
Code:
C:\Users\Colin>ftp rt-ac68u

That might indicate that you have a larger problem than just FTP.

Thanks for the detailed information/knowledge, I'll keep going at it and see if I can figure it out.
In terms of the USB, yes it's very strange.
My camera(s) will just need to send images through the FTP, so I will stick with the USB 2.0 slot, but yes super strange that my 2.4Ghz just doesn't work when using the 3.0 slot.

USB 3 can generate noise that can interfere with 2.4GHz signals (that's why there is 'Reduce USB3 interference' setting on the 2.4GHz Professional page to run USB3 as USB2).
Usually the problems occur with external drives where there is a 'cheap' USB3 cable used that isn't properly shielded.
What brand of USB stick?
Sounds like it may be a poor design....or you need to move it away from the router with a 'good' USB3 extension cable.

Hey John, it is an 8GB flash drive: Kingston DataTraveler USB3.0.
Nothing fancy, my wife got it from work.
As soon as I plugged it in, the 2.4Ghz and my guest network (also 2.4) wouldn't show up on my devices.
If I end up wanting to add more storage through the router (like one of my external HDD's), I have a few USB extension cords that I can try.
Thanks for the info on that.

You're having a problem with passive mode. This usually indicates that your firewall hasn't been configured properly.
Also, I can see that you are connecting to your external (WAN) IP address. Is this intentional? Are you connecting from outside your LAN?
What happens if you connect locally? Your client appears to be on 192.168.2.105?

I have an Asus RT-AC68U router, but I assume most of the recent models carry the same interface. Here is my issue.
I started both the windows samba and ftp features for an attached USB to this router. The issue is that the ftp server the router started is being made public to wan side and I could not find a feature to disable it.
As a temporary measure I port forwarded 192.168.1.1:20 & 21 to forward to ip 127.0.0.1:20 & 21 for tcp traffic.
That seemed to work but I don't know if there is a better solution.
Or if this is an appropriate solution to hide the ftp server.
Is there a tool to check if I have any other open ports to the wan side?
I would like to close my entire lan network off from the outside.
If I need to get into the lan side of my network, I do have a vpn server running on this router that I perfer to use.
Question 2:
I also have a 4TB WD MyCloud that I tried to close off from the outside entirely. I went to firewall -> network services filter and blacklisted all requests from the source lan ip 192.168.1.100, putting a wildcard of *.*.*.* in the destination ip, trying to give the mycloud zero outside access.
I disable this rule every couple months just to keep the firmware updated.
Are my security measures correct?
They seem to work, but I am a rookie when it comes to networking.

1. Usb applications then servers center then ftp tab. Turn off ftp wan access, maybe even turn off anonymous access.
2. For the mycloud, I think if you disable the cloud ability, it won't respond to wan requests.

As for FTP server, yes, it is meant to be accessed from the WAN, and I don't recall if there is a way to turn that off with the official firmware or not.
I would use iptables to fix this, something like
iptables -I INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP (if it is eth0)
iptables -I INPUT -i xxx -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP
(where xxx is the interface of the WAN)
That just means for input, on the WAN device (eth0 or whatever), and it is tcp port 21, then drop the connection.
You can use iptables for your other question as well, except you want output instead of input, and of course, the right ports and all that.

1. Usb applications then servers center then ftp tab. Turn off ftp wan access, maybe even turn off anonymous access.
2. For the mycloud, I think if you disable the cloud ability, it won't respond to wan requests.

Do you have the same router?
What fw? Seems I am missing that option. Bellow are my options:
Enable FTP
Allow anonymous login
Maximum number of concurrent connections
Character set on FTP Server
I did disable mycloud cloud access in its GUI and do believe it works, but just tried to double protect myself if the samba shares somehow get forwarded outside my lan and onto the wan thru some uPnP glitch.
Maybe paranoid but better safe then sorry, 4Tb is a lot of personal documents.
I don't believe this router has iptables support but ill try to look it up. I'm not really looking to switch to ddwrt, openwrt, tomato, etc to get that support.
This router is rock stable and performance is insane.

I have the ac56u and am using the merlin fork (stock with some modifications/updates)
http://www.snbforums.com/threads/fork-update-for-374-43-available-v13e1.18914/
My ftp page looks like this...
You can use the regular merlin firmware (stock with modifications) too
http://www.snbforums.com/threads/asuswrt-merlin-378-55-is-now-available.25874/
The merlin fork is based on older asus firmware before they locked down wifi transmit power. He just updates all of the packages and fixes to the latest, while also adding merlin's tweaks.
The regular merlin firmware is based on the latest asus firmware (after they locked down transmit power) with his own updates, fixes, and tweaks.

Ready-to-Fill Disposable Liquids Totes
The Ready-to-Fill design offers all of the material handling advantages of a rigid Intermediate-Bulk-Container (IBC) with all the benefits of a disposable IBC. J Hill Container™ Ready-to-Fill totes are an ideal replacement for drums, returnable totes, bottle-in-cage IBCs, and other corrugated IBCs. Reduce your time and labor required for the filling, emptying, and handling of multiple containers with one Ready-to-Fill Tote replacing up to six drums and carrying up to 330 gallons of liquid.
As a replacement for returnable totes, Ready-to-Fill Totes eliminate the high cost of maintenance and return transportation. Versatile use with industrial chemicals (such as: adhesives, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), water-based emulsions, heavy greases, lubricating oils, surfactants, paints, and coatings), and aseptic, white room or bulk commodities (such as: fruit juices, fruit purees, glycerin, propylene glycol, edible oils, fish oil, salad dressings, molasses, wine, liquid sweeteners and flavorings).

I posted below as answer on the Asus forum and decided to post it here as well for reference:
With firmware 3.0.0.4.376.3861 the router FTP server feature works very simple, older versions may behave different:
General>USB Application>Media Services and Servers>FTP Share Tab
Set Enable FTP to On, accept the warning message.
Make sure you have media plugged in one of the router USB ports, with a folder which has the user rights set (the best is to make the folder through the router Add new folder utility):
You can now access the router FTP server (folder "data" in above example) over the outside Internet, by either router WAN IP address or DNS name (if set), port number 21 and by default the administrator username and password.
You can also access the router FTP server over the LAN, by either the WAN IP address or LAN IP address, nice huh?
Warning: FTP use in this way is rather unsafe, as the user credentials for FTP are send over the Internet without encryption (standard FTP behaviour). For sure you shall not allow anonymous login.
For local access over the LAN you beter use the Samba feature, straight forward as above.
Note: you shall not configure port forwarding for this FTP feature to work, if you set a port forward to port 21, you break the router FTP server. And you do not need to enable Web access from WAN.

Hence the warning in my post.
There is no further choice though in AsusWRT, the router FTP feature is all or nothing.
At least create a dedicated FTP account.
Better no FTP I would say.
